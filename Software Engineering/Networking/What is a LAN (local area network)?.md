# [What is a LAN (local area network)?](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-a-lan/)

* LAN is a network contained within a small geographic area (usually the same building)
* LANs connect to the Internet via a router
  * Home LANs use a single router
  * Office LANs may use network switches
* Ethernet is a protocol for physical network connections
* WiFi is a protocol for connecting to a network via radio waves
* Requires networking equipment for packet switching, like a network switch
  * Allows connected devices to exchange data

## Virtual LAN

* Split up traffic on the same physical network into two different networks
* Like having two separate LANs, with their own router and Internet connection
  * Divided virtually using software instead of physically using hardware
  * Only one router with an Internet connection is necessary
* Network management becomes easier when using VLANs to subdivide the network

## WAN vs. LAN

* WAN (Wide Area Network) is a collection of connected LANs
