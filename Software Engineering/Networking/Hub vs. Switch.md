[Hub vs. Switch](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/3krxey/eli5what_is_the_difference_between_a_switch_an/)
* Hub = as if every device was connected to every other device
* If one machine sends data to a hub, then every machine connected to that hub receives that data
* Switch looks at the MAC address in the data packet
* Switch sends packet to only the matching computer
* Router often includes a switch + hub, but its purpose is to connect 2+ networks
* A hub is like a giant room where everyone is shouting at each other and if the timing is wrong everyone can interfere with each other
* Switch is like a romm that has a messenger delivering messages, and a router lets you talk to rooms somewhere else
* Hubs are not used anymore
