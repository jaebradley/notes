# [Ethereum Gas Explained In Plain English](https://medium.com/coinmonks/ethereum-gas-explained-in-plain-english-d9e60a699c54)

* A smart contract contains commands executed by a computer
  * When a smart contract runs, it consumes someone's computing power like your car engine consumes gasoline
  * This person needs to be paid for the provided computing resources
* Every command in a smart contract has a price measured in terms of gas
  * Some commands cost more, some commands cost less, but they are never free
  * Like a car, it will consume different amounts of gasoline depending on whether you are driving on a highway, going uphill, etc
  * Similarly, different commands in a smart contract put different strain on a computer and thus consume different amounts of gas
* When a smart contract is invoked, you specify how much you are willing to pay for gas and can specify a maximum amount of gas that you are willing to spend
