# [3.3 Arithmetic Errors - Unsigned Integer](https://bob.cs.sonoma.edu/IntroCompOrg-RPi/sec-aritherr.html)

* Using four bits to simplify discussion - consider the following arithmetic operations
  * `0010 + 0100` (`2 + 4`)
    * The result is `6` which can fit in `4` bits, so the carry condition is `0`
  * `0100 + 1110` (`4 + 14`)a
    * The result is `18`, which cannot fit in `4` bits, so the carry condition is `1`
    * If we were to only use `4` bits, the result would be `0010` which is `2` in decimal
  * Same type of situation when subtracting `14` from `4` (`0100 - 1110`)
    * The carry condition is `1` since to get the correct result, borrowing outside the `4` bits had to occur
* These `4` bit examples can be generated to any size arithmetic performed by the computer
* When adding or subtracting two unsigned integers, the result is arithmetically if and only if the carry condition flag is set to zero
