# [3.6 Arithmetic Errors - Signed Integers](https://bob.cs.sonoma.edu/IntroCompOrg-RPi/sec-ovrflw.html)

* The flags register (`CPSR`) provides an overflow condition flag bit (`V`) for detecting whether the sum of two `n`-bit signed numbers stored in two's complement exceed the range allocated for it
* Each operation that affets the overflow condition flag sets the flag to the exclusive or of the carry into the highest-order bit of the operands and the ultimate carry
  * For example, when adding `00010101` and `01101111`, there is a carry of `0` and a penultimate carry of `1` (there is a carry from the operations in the 7th bit from the right into the 8th bit from the right / the highest-order bit)
  * The overflow condition flag would be equal to the exclusive or of the carry and the penultimate carry which is `0 ^ 1` or `1`
* If adding or subtracting two unsigned integers, the carry condition is zero if and only if the result is within the `n`-bit range
  * So only the carry condition matters and not the overflow condition flag
* If adding or subtracting two signed integers, the overflow condition flag is zero if and only if the result is within the `n`-bit range
  * The carry condition does not matter - only the overflow condition flag matters
* So previous example would be a valid operation between two unsigned integers but not two signed integers (`21 + 111`)
  * `132` is within the range of `8` bits but `132` is not within the range of `7`-bits (since the highest-order bit is used to carry the sign)
* The CPU does not consider integers to be signed or unsigned - both `C` and `V` are set according to the rules of binary arithmetic
  * The program must check the state of `C` and `V` for unsigned and signed integers, respectively
