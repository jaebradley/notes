# [The Stack](https://bob.cs.sonoma.edu/IntroCompOrg-RPi/sec-stack.html)

* A stack is typically implemented by dedicating a continguous area of memory to it
  * A stack can grow towards numerically higher memory addresses (ascending stack) or numerically lower memory addresses (descending stack)
  * The stack pointer is implemented by pointing to the last item that was stored on the stack (a full stack implementation) or the location where the next item _will_ be stored on the stack (an empty stack implementation, since the location is "empty")
* So technically, there are 4 different possible implementations - ARM implements a *full-descending* stack
* The reason for growing from high addresses to low addresses is to allocate as much memory as possible to a dynamic structure (since you don't know how much stack space is required for a given program)
  * Program instrutions should be stored at low memory addresses, since this allows maximum flexibility with respect to different program sizes
  * In order to allocate as much space as possible while avoiding collision with the program instructions, start at the highest address and grow towards lower addresses
