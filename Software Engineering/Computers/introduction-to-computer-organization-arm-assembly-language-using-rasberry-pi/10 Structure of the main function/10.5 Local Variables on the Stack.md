# [10.5 Local Variables on the Stack](https://bob.cs.sonoma.edu/IntroCompOrg-RPi/sec-varstack.html)

* Allocate memory space on the stack by subtracting the number of bytes from the stack pointer, since the stack grows toward lower memory addresses
* Save values on the stack in this newly allocated memory area
* Once we have retrieved any saved values, deallocate the stack memory area by adding the number of bytes that were saved to the stack pointer

## The Frame Pointer

* We will create local variables on the stack in the same way we store values on the stack - by subtracting the number of bytes required by each variable from the stack pointer
* Establish a point on the stack and use this address to directly access values on the stack relative to this address
* Each function has control over an area on the stack called the stack frame
  * The frame pointer register contains an address that serves as a reference point for the stack frame
  * Items on the stack frame can be readily accessed relative to the frame pointer using offsets
* In the example function, a character is read and held in memory
  * The instruction that allocates the memory for this local variable is something like `sub     sp, sp, #8      @@ allocate memory for local var`
  * This instruction moves the stack pointer 8 bytes
* The location in the stack frame for storing the input character is computed relative to the frame pointer
  * `sub     r3, fp, #5      @@ compute address` - this instruction subtracts `5` from the address in the frame pointer register and stores the result in register `r3`, ready to be passed to the `read` function

## Designing the Prologue and Epilogue

* For the example function, stack looks something like

```
Offset | Value
  -12  | empty (Stack Pointer)
  -8   | 7 empty bytes, 1 byte for character
  -4   | Caller's frame pointer 
   0   | Return address (Frame Pointer)
```

* The offsets are negative since stack goes from higher memory addresses to lower memory addresses
* The prologue to the function comprises of the following three instructions
  * Save the return address and caller's frame pointer, plus any other registers that need to be saved
  * Calculate the frame pointer based on the stack pointer - the frame pointer should point to the return address
  * Allocate memory on the stack for the local variables in the function
    * calculate the number of bytes required by local variables 
* The epilogue of the function starts by subtracting the number of total bytes required by local variables from the stack pointer
  * The second instruction pops two values off the top of the stack into the frame pointer and the link register
  * This restores the calling function's value in the frame pointer and return address
  * Frame pointer points to an address where the previous stored frame pointer and then the return address

```
Offset | Value
  -12  | deallocated
  -8   | deallocated
  -4   | caller's fp (Stack Pointer)
   0   | return address
```
