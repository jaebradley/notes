# [8.4 Program Execution in the CPU](https://bob.cs.sonoma.edu/IntroCompOrg-RPi/sec-progexec.html)

* Instruction register always has the memory address of the next instruction to be executed
  * A sequence of instructions is stored in memory
  * The memory addresses where the first instruction is located is copied to the program counter
  * The CPU sends the address in the program counter to memory via the address bus
  * Main memory responds by sending a copy of the state of the bits at that memory location on the data bus, which the CPU then copies into its instruction register
  * Instruction pointer is automatically incremented to contain the address of the next instruction in memory
  * CPU executes the instruction in the instruction register
  * Repeat for next instruction unless instruction is wait for interruption instruction
   * If the instruction is the wait for interruption instruction, the instruction will put the CPU in an idle state, until an I/O device sends an interrupt signal to the CPU
* When you wish to indicate to the operating system that you wish to execute a program, the operating system locates a region of memory large enough to hold the instructions in the program and then copies from from the file to memory
* An editor is used to create source files
* A compiler or assembler is used to create object files - files that contain bit patterns that can be used by a CPU
* A linker is used to create an executable file
  * The linker program will merge machine code from several object files into one executable file
