# [Multiplexing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplexing#:~:text=Examples%20include%20an%20analogue%20stereo,network%2C%20and%20a%20mesh%20network)

* Multiple analog/digital signals are combined into one signal over some shared medium
* Used to share a scarce resource (e.g. several telephone calls are combined over one wire)
* Divides the capacity of the communication device into many logical channels
* Demultiplexing extracts the original channels on the receiving end

## Frequency-division Multiplexing

* Combines several signals in one medium by sending the signals in several distinct frequency ranges
* Radio / TV are examples
* Single cable used to connect to residential area, but the service provider sends multiple TV channels simulatenously over the cable to all subscribers without interference
* Receivers need to tune to the appropriate frequency ("channel") to access the desired signal
