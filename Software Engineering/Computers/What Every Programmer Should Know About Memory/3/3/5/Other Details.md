# Other Details

* There are two types of addresses - virtual addresses and physical addresses
* Virtual addresses are not unique - a virtual address can refer to different physical memory addresses over time
* The same address in different processes also likely refers to different physical addresses
* The Memory Management Unit translates the virtual addresses used during execution into physical addresses
