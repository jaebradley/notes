# zip

* Can specify multiple files to `zip` like `zip outputfile.zip file1 file2 file 3`
* `-r` option to zip an entire directory
* `-x` option to exclude files or directories from the `zip`ped output. Can specify wildcards (`*`)
* `-e` option encrpts the files with a password
* Difference between `zip` and `gzip` is that `gzip` is only capable of compressing a single file (stream of data) while `zip` can compress multiple files
