# Chapter 3. Devices

## Device Files

* The kernel presents many of the device I/O interfaces to user processes as files
* For the following command `echo blah blah > /dev/null` the `blah blah` is sent from standard output to a file
  * Since the "file" is the "null" device, the kernel decides what to do with any data written to this device (which is to ignore the input and throw away the data)
* To identify a device, devices will have a `b` (block), `c` (character), `p` (pipe), or `s` (socket) as the first character when calling the `ls` program

## dd and Devices

* The `dd` program's sole function is to read from an input file or stream and write to an output file or stream, possibly doing some encoding conversion on the way
* `dd` copies data in blocks of a fixed size
* `dd if=/dev/zero of=new_file bs=1023 count=1`
  * Copy a single 1024-byte block from `/dev/zero` (a continuous stream of zero bytes) to `new_file`
  * `if=file` represents the input file, default is standard input
  * `of=file` represents the output file, default is standard output
  * `bs=size` represents the block size
  * `ibs=size, obs=size` represent the input and output block sizes if they need to differ
  * `count=num` represents the total number of blocks to copy. When working with a huge file or a device that supplies an endless stream of data, like `/dev/zero` you want `dd` to stop at a fixed point or you could waste a lot of disk space
