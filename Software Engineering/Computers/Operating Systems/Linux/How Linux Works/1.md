# Chapter 1. The Big Picture

## Levels and Layers of Abstraction in a Linux System

* The kernel is the core of the operating system
  * It is software residing in memory that tells the CPU what to do
  * The kernel manages the hardware and acts primarily as an interface between the hardware and any running program
* User space is made up of user processes, which are the running programs that the kernel managers
* The kernel runs in kernel mode and the user processes run in user mode
* Code running in kernel mode has unrestricted access to the processor and main memory
  * The area that only the kernel can access is called kernel space
* User mode restricts access to a comparatively small subset of memory and safe CPU operations
  * If a process makes a mistake and crashes, the consequences are limited and can be cleaned up by the kernel

## The Kernel

* The kernel is responsible for determining which processes are allowed to use the CPU
* The kernel needs to keep track of all memory - what is currently allocated to a particular process, what might be shared between processes, and what is free
* The kernel acts as an interface between hardware (like a disk) and processes
* Processes normally use system calls to communicate with the kernel

### Process Management

* In a system with a one-core CPU, many processes may be able to use the CPU, but only one process may actually use the CPU at any given time
* In practice, each process uses the CPU for a small fraction of a second, pauses, then another process uses the CPU for another small fraction of a second, etc. (context switching)
* Situation is a process running in user mode, but it stime slice is up
  * The CPU interrupts the current process based on an internal timer, switches into kernel mode, and hands control back to the kernel
  * The kernel records the current state of the CPU and memory, which will be essential to resuming the process that was just interrupted
  * The kernel analyzyes the list of processes that are ready to run and chooses one
  * The kernel prepares the memory for this new process, and then prepares the CPU
  * The kernel tells the CPU how long the time slice for the new process will last
  * The kernel switches the CPU into user mode and hands control of the CPU to the process
  * The kernel "runs" between process time slices during a context switch

### Memory Management

* The kernel must have it's own private area of memory that user processes can't access
* Each user process needs its own section of memory
* One use process may not access the private memory of another process
* User processes can share memory
* Some memory in user processes can be read-only
* The system can use more memory than is physically present by using disk space as auxillary
* Modern CPUs include a memory management unit, that enables a memory access scheme called virtual memory
  * A process does not directly access the memory by its physical location in the hardware
  * The kernel sets up each process to act as if it had an entire machine to itself
  * When the process accesses some of its memory, the MMU intercepts the access and uses a memory address map to translate the memory location from the process into an actual physical memory location on the machine
  * During a context switch, the kernel has to change the map from the outgoing process to the incoming process

## System Calls and Support

* A system call is an interaction between a process and the kernel
* When a process calls `fork`, the kernel creates a nearly identical copy of the process
* When a process calls `exec` the kernel starts the program specified as an argument to `exec`, replacing the current process
* All user processes start as a result of `fork`
* When you enter `ls` into a terminal window, the shell (i.e. the program that the terminal sends user input to) running inside the terminal window calls `fork()` to create a copy of the shell, and then the new copy of the shell calls `exec(ls)` to run `ls`
