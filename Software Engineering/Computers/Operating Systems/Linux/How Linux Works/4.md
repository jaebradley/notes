# Chapter 4. Disks and Filesystems

* Partitions are subdivisions of the whole disk
  * On Linux, they're denoted with a number after the whole block device (like `/dev/sda1`
  * The kernel presents each partition as a block device
  * Partitions are defined on a small area of the disk called a partition table
* The next layer after the partition is the filesystem, the database of files and directories that can be interacted in the user space
* If you want to access data in a file, need to get the appropriate partition location from the partition table and then search the filesystem database on that partition for the desired file data

### Disk and Partition Geometry

* Disk consists of a spinning platter on a spindle, with a head attached to a moving arm that can sweep across the radius of the disk
* As the disk spins underneath the head, the head reads data
* When the arm is in one position, the head can only read data from a fixed circle
* The circle is called a cylinder because larger disks have more than one platter, all stacked and spinning around the same spindle
* Each platter can have one or two heads, for the top and/or bottom of the platter, and all heads are attached to the same arm and move in concert
* There are many cylinders on the disk, from small ones around the center to large ones around the periphery of the disk
* A cylinder can be divided into slices called sectors
* Cylinders are ideal boundaries from partitions as reading data from a cylinder is very fast because the head can continuously pick up data as the disk spins
* A partition arranged as a set of adjacent cylinders also allows for fast continuous data access because the head doesn't need to move very far between cylinders

### Solid State Disks (SSDs)

* Storage devices with no moving parts do not have problems with random access because there's no head to sweep across a platter
* When you read data from an SSD, you read it in chunks (typically 4kb at a time) and the read must begin at a multiple of 4kb
* If your partition and its data do not lie on a 4kb boundary, you may do two reads instead of one

## Filesystems

### Mounting a Filesystem

* On Unix, the process of attaching a filesystem is called mounting
* When the system boots, the kernel reads some configuration data and mounts root based on the configuration data
* In order to mount a filesystem, you must know the following
  * The filesystem's device (like a disk partition)
  * The filesystem type
  * The mount point i.e. the place in the current system's directory hierarchy where the filesystem will be attached. The mount point is always a normal directory.

### Disk Buffering, Caching, and Filesystems

* Buffers write to the disk, meaning that the kernel usually doesn't immediately write changes to the filesystems when processes request changes
* Instead, it stores the changes in RAM until the kernel can conveniently make the actual change to the disk
* When you unmount a filesystem with `umount`, the kernel automatically synchronizes with the disk
* At any other time, you can force the kernel to write the changes in its buffer to the disk by running the `sync` command
* The kernel has a series of mechanisms that use RAM to automatically cache blocks read from a disk
  * If one or more processes repeatedly access a file, the kernel doesn't have to go to the disk again and again, it can simply read from teh cache

### Filesystem Capacity

* To view the size and utilization of your currently mounted filesystems, use the `df` command
* The first column is the filesystem device, the capacity of the filesystem, the amount of the filesystem that is used, the amount of free filesystem available, the percentage of the filesystem that is used, and the mount point of the filesystem
* To find out where all of the space-hogging media files are, use the `du` command (or `du -s` for summary mode)

## Inside a Traditional Filesystem

* A traditional Unix filesystem has two primary components - a pool of data blocks where you can store data and a database system that manages the data pool
* The data base is centered around the inode data structure, which is a set of data that describes a particular file (type, permissions, where in the data pool the file data resides)
* Filenames and directories are implemented as inodes where a directory inode contains a list of filenames and corresponding links to other inodes
* To examine some file at `some_dir/some_file` the kernel does the following
  * Determines the paths' components - a directory named `some_dir` followed by a component named `some_file`
  * Follows the root inode to its directory data
  * Finds the name `some_dir` in the root inode's directory data, which points to another inode
  * Looks up that inode and verifies that it is a directory
  * Follows `some_dir`'s data and looks up its directory information
  * Locates the second component (`some_file`) in the directory's data and identifies the inode id for `some_file`
  * Looks up the `some_file` inode in the inode table
* Can see the inode ids for any directory by executing `ls -i`
* `ls -l` also exposes the link count for a given inode
  * The link count field for a given inode is the number of total directory entries across all directories that point to that specific inode
  * Most files have a link count of 1 because they occur only once across all directory entries
  * However, when a file is hard linked to another file, you may see values greater than 1 since a hard link is just a manually created entry in a directory to an inode that already exists
* The filesystem reserves a bit map for the used / unused data blocks where a `0` indicates a block is free and a `1` means that it is in use
* Problems in a filesystem occur when the inode table data doesn't match the block allocation data or when the link counts are incorrect, which can happen when you don't cleanly shut down a system
  * The `fsck` program walks through the inode table and the directory structure to generate new link counts and a new block allocation map and then it compares the newly generated data with the filesystem on disk
  * If there are mismatches, `fsck` must fix the link counts and determine what to do with any inodes and/or data that didn't come up when it traversed the directory structure
  * Most `fsck` programs make these orphans new files in the filesystem's lost+found directory
