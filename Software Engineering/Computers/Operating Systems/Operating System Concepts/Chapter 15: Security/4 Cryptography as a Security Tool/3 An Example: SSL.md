# 15.4.3 SSL

* Asymmetric cryptography is used so that a client and a server can establish a secure session key
  * Session key is used for _symmetric_ encryption of the session between the two
* The server is assumed to have obtained a certificate from a certification authority
  * Certificate contains the server's DNS name
  * Public encryption algorithm of the server
  * Public key of the server
  * Validity interval during which the certificate should be considered valid
* Client connects to server, sending a 28-byte random value to the server
* Server responds with a random value, plus its certificate
* Client verifies that the server's certificate matches the digital signature for the certificate distributed by the certificate authority
  * If this verification step is successful, then the server has proven is identity
* Client generates a 46-byte premaster secret and sends the secret to the server with the value encrypted using the public encryption algorithm in the certificate as well as the public key in the certificate
* Server (should) be the only entity with the private key, so only it should be able to decode the premaster secret
* Now the client and the server are the only entities that should have knowledge of the premaster secret, and the two random values (one generated by the client, the other generated by the server)
  * A master secret is computed using a one-way hash function
  * This master secret is used as a session key for communication between the client and the server
  * Master secret is used to generate a _symmetric_ encryption key for encrypting messages from client to server (separate _symmetric_ key is generated for encrypting messages from server to client)
  * Symmetric decryption is a lot less computationally expensive than asymmetric decryption
