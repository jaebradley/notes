* Git notes enable you to amend new information about old commits
* Can add notes to objects, commits, blobs, trees
* `git notes add -m ‘some message’` to add notes to the latest commit
* And then it will show up in `git log` in a `Notes` section
* For example, in the `git` project, git notes on a commit reference the thread where the  changes were discussed
* Can also use git notes for adding review / testing information
