# [Preemptive commit comments](https://arialdomartini.wordpress.com/2012/09/03/pre-emptive-commit-comments/)
* Write commit comments before coding
* Write what the software should do, not what you did
* Two questions that should be answered via commits
  * What's the project behavior in this snapshot?
    * vs. what did the programmer write in this coding session
* Describe the current state of the software and not what the state of the software *was* - tell what the state is **now** and use the present tense
* Makes it easier to context switch and reduce cognitive load
  * In the same way that a failing test communicates to developers the next step to perform (and thus reduces cognitive load about what is working / not working)
* Commit message becomes a declaration of intent (i.e. a *commitment*)
* Pre-emptive commits are a forcing function for discussing the specific behaviors and domain concepts
* Pre-emptive comimts also define a (micro) goal around when the current logic being worked on is "done"
  * Micro-goals through pre-emptive commits and macro-goals through feature branch naming (which is pre-emptive)
