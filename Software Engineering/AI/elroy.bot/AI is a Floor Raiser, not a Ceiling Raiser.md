* Learning resources need to be created with the target learner in mind
* "Trying to learn Topic A, but only have knowledge in Related Topic B. Finding learning resources that teach Topic A in terms of Related Topic B is difficult."
* "To effectively learn Topic A, you need to learn Prequisite Skill B. But as a beginner, you don't know you need to learn Prerequisite Skill B."
* Learning with AI can meet you at your skill level
  * Can (attempt to) directly answer your questions at your level of understanding
* Mastery remains difficult, because master-level training data is rare
* Cheating in AI, in the long-term, won't lead to prosperity as cheaters will plateau at whatever competency AI can provide
* The mastery needed to improve large, complex codebases is different than the mastery needed to work on a side-project
* Author is skeptical that creativity will be impacted by AI-generated content
  * Author's thesis is that creative fields are competitive and that beating competition for attention requires novelty
  * Novelty is requirement for successful creative work because humans are good at detecting when something they are consuming is derivative
* Tasks that already have specialized applications will not see disruption
  * Email applications already have filtering and organizational tools, so the need for AI to filter or summarize the content is already competing with built-in filtering behavior
