# [An LLM is a lossy encyclopedia](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Aug/29/lossy-encyclopedia/)
* Huge array of facts compressed into them, but that compression is lossy
* Key is to develop an intuition for questions that can be usefully answered by an LLM vs. questions that are at a level of detail where lossiness matters
  * Make a correct example available to it and don't expect it to know extremely specific facts
  * Treat it as a tool that can act on facts presented to it
