# [The Scam Called “You Don't Have to Remember Anything”](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/the-scam-called-you-dont-have-to-remember-anything/)
* To find what you need online, you require a solid general education and, above all, prior knowledge in the area related to your search
* Using the internet is less and less to our advantage because we have less and less prior knowledge
  * In effect, we detrain ourselves out of the ability to access quality of information and turn it into actual knowledge
  * "Digital natives" lack the critical and analytics thinking skills to evaluate information they find on the internet
  * Need to fully develop a mental map of the subject to derive value from the results of an internet search
* If you can't produce a comprehensive answer with confidence and within seconds, you don't have sufficient background knowledge
  * "I ask ChatGPT for more background knowledge" - how do you know the answers that are returned are valid?
* Knowledge work is not bottlenecked by externally available information
  * It is bottle-necked by the skill and knowledge of the worker
