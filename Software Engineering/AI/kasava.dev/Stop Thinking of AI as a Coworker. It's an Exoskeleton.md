* Companies that treat AI as an autonomous agent that should "just figure it out" tend to be disappointed
  * In contrast, companies that treat AI as an extension of their existing workforce as an amplifier of human capability rather than a replacement, are seeing better results
* The physical, industrial exoskeleton equivalent doesn't replace humans (i.e. lift boxes independently) - it amplifies what a human can do
* Don't ask "can AI do a developer's job" but instead ask "what are the N things a developer does in a given week, and which of those things can be amplified?"
  * "What are the most repetitive, error-prone, fatigue-inducing parts of our workers' jobs, and how can AI reduce the friction there?"
* These "micro-agents" do one thing well and with a high-degree of reliability

* Play-Doh analogy: Play-Doh gives the power of sculpting to everybody, but if you don't want to make an ugly mess, you have to be a competent sculptor to begin with, and that involves learning fundamentals.
  * There's a reason why clay animators are skilled professionals.
  * The quality of vibe-coded software is proportional to the programming skills of the vibe coder, as well as the effort put into it, like with all software.
