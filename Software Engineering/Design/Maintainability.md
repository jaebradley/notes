## [How would you know if you've written readable and easily maintainable code?](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/141005/how-would-you-know-if-youve-written-readable-and-easily-maintainable-code)
* Sometimes the best way to know is to come back to code written months previously and try and understand what it was written to do
* **Maintainable** if you **and** someone else can maintain it _without asking for help_
* **Readable** if _someone else_ can correctly understand the design, layout, and intent
* "From trigger pull to something useful actually happening, how many method calls does it take? How many methods pass the exact same or most of the same exact parameters on to another method call?"
