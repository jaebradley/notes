# [Three Laws of Software Complexity (or: why software engineers are always grumpy)](https://maheshba.bitbucket.io/blog/2024/05/08/2024-ThreeLaws.html)

# The First Law of Software Complexity: A well-designed system will degrade into a badly designed system over time.

* well-designed system will degrade into a badly-designed system over time
* well-designed = easy to change over time, while badly-designed is difficult to change over time
* the 2nd derivative of code quality is always negative - it goes down over time

# The Third Law of Software Complexity: There is no fundamental upper limit on Software Complexity.

* No fundamental upper limit on Software Complexity
* People are idiosyncratic and politics can dictate technical decisions, leading to system shapes that donâ€™t make sense in a vacuum, but were designed to appease a coworker or to avoid antagonizing a teammate
