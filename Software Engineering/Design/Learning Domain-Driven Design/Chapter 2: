# Chapter 2. Discovering Domain Knowledge

## Model of the Business Domain

* Model is not a copy of the real world, just a human construct to help make sense of real-world systems
* Canonnical example of a model is a map
* Map types don't represent all the details of the planet - each map type contains just enough data to support that map's purpose

### Effective Modeling

* A model is an abstraction
* The idea of "abstraction' allows us to handle complexity by omitting unnecessary details and leaving only what's needed for solving the problem at hand
