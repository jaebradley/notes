# [Disjoint Set Union (DSU)/Union-Find - A Complete Guide](https://leetcode.com/discuss/general-discussion/1072418/Disjoint-Set-Union-(DSU\)Union-Find-A-Complete-Guide)

* Sets are disjoint if the intersection of any two sets is `NULL` (i.e. they do not overlap)
* Usually the problem involves several elements with each element in a separate set, initially
* Two types of operations
  * Combine two given sets
  * Evaluate the connectivity of two elements (if they are in the same set, or not)

## Example

* Initial elements of `a`, `b`, `c`,...,`h`, each in their own set
