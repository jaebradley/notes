# [The Guerrilla Guide to Interviewing (version 3.0)](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2006/10/25/the-guerrilla-guide-to-interviewing-version-30/)

### Interviewing Team

* At least six people should interview the candidate
* At least five should be peers

### Hiring Decision

* If 2/6 of the interviewers decide that the candidate is not worth hiring, they should not be hired
* Decision is hire / no hire - no middle ground
  * Never "hire, but not for my team" -> should just be a no hire decision
* A candidate that is very good at a particular task but not very good at other tasks / would not be very good on another team should be a no hire
* A "maybe" is a no hire
* Much better to reject a good candidate than accept a bad candidate
  * Bad candidates cost money and effort and other people's time fixing bugs
  * Firing a bad hire can take months and be difficult
  * Bad employees demoralize good employees
* When evaluating a candidate, imagine there are many people lined up for the job (to avoid lowering standards)
* Feedback should be immediate (within 15 minutes of the interview ending)
* If you're having trouble deciding - no hire

### Smart + Gets Things Done

* Smart, but doesn't get things done
 * Often PhDs that work at big companies where nobody listens to them because they are completely impractical
* Not smart, but get things done
 * Somebody else will have to clean up their mess
 * Net liabilities as they fail to contribute and soak up good people's time

### Worst Kinds of Interviewers

* Blowhard
 * Talks the entire time
 * Hires everyone and think all candidates are smart because the candidate thinks like them
* Quiz Show Interviewer
 * Thinks smart = knows a lot of facts

### Prejudice

* Don't listen to recruiters ("you're gonna love this candidate)
* Don't ask around about the person before the interview
* Don't talk to the other interviewers about the candidate until you've both made independent decisions

## Looking for Passion

* Smart people are passionate about the projects they work on
* Challenge passionate candidates (for example, by challenging probably truthful statements they make about their passion areas) and seeing if they defend their position (and how)

## Communication

* Good candidates are careful to explain things well
* "Explain this in terms my grandmother could understand"

## Good Fundamentals

* Anectdote about a math professor teaching Calculus at Yale
* The speed at which students could solve a "simple" algebra problem was a good predictor of the final grade
* If you can't whiz through the easy stuff, you're never gonna get the advanced stuff
* The best programmers have an easy aptitude for dealing with multiple levels of abstraction
* Things like recursion (holding multiple levels of the call stack at the same time) or pointer-algorithms
* Understanding pointers is an aptitude (not a skill)
 * Pointers require a complex form of doubly-indirected thinking that some people can't do
  * Source of "famous" interview questions like reversing a linked list
* "I want programmers to know programming down to the CPU level"
* "All programmers make mistakes, there’s nothing wrong with that, they just have to be able to find them"
* "Very, very rarely, you will find a candidate that doesn’t have any bugs the first time. In this case, this question is even more fun. When you say, “There’s a bug in that code,” they will review their code carefully, and then you get to see if they can be diplomatic yet firm in asserting that the code is perfect."
