# [The Guerrilla Guide to Interviewing (version 3.0)](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2006/10/25/the-guerrilla-guide-to-interviewing-version-30/)

* At least six people should interview the candidate
  * At least five should be peers
* If 2/6 of the interviewers decide that the candidate is not worth hiring, they should not be hired
* Decision is hire / no hire - no middle ground
  * Never "hire, but not for my team" -> should just be a no hire decision
* A candidate that is very good at a particular task but not very good at other tasks / would not be very good on another team should be a no hire
* A "maybe" is a no hire
* Much better to reject a good candidate than accept a bad candidate
  * Bad candidates cost money and effort and other people's time fixing bugs
  * Firing a bad hire can take months and be difficult
  * Bad employees demoralize good employees
* When evaluating a candidate, imagine there are many people lined up for the job (to avoid lowering standards)
* Smart, but doesn't get things done
