# [If you don't tinker, you don't have taste](https://seated.ro/blog/tinkering-a-lost-art)
* There are two kinds of people - those who do things only if it helps them achieve a goal, and those who do things just because. The ideal, is to be a mix of both
* When you tinker and throw away, that's practice
  * Practice should inherently be ephemeral, exploratory, and frequent
* Have done many things that in hindsight increased appreciation for programming, but seemed "unnecessary" in the strictest sense
  * "No time spent learning, is time wasted"
* If you never try various things, you will not acquire good taste
* Taste is the ability to distinguish mediocrity from excellence
  * You should not have the same taste as someone else
