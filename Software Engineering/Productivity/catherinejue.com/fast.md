* Slow software limits us more than we realize
* Superhuman's sub-100ms rule + focus on keyboard shortcuts are product advantages
* fast = "magical"
  * Another product example: Instagram automatically uploading images optimistically when users entered a caption to make the upload experience feel instant
* Fast software has nowhere to hide
  * Network calls and dependencies reveal themselves through latency
  * Companies that do fast very well tend to have very focused products
* Making software fast often requires stripping away essential features and building more complex technology behind the scenes
