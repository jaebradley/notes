# [How I ship projects at big tech companies](https://www.seangoedecke.com/how-to-ship/)

* Projects almost always ship because one single person makes them ship
  * Not writing the code or doing the work
  * Person has end-to-end understanding of the whole thing, effectively single responsible engineer
* Shipping != deploying code or making a feature available to a user
* A project is shipped only when the important people at your company believe it is shipped
  * If you deploy a system and a manager, VP, CEO is unhappy with it, you did not ship the project
* Author contends that if you ship something that users hate and makes no money, but your leadership team is happy, you still shipped
* Leadership team will be trusting you for estimates, answering technical questions, anticipating technical problems
  * Maintaining this trust is the top priority
  * If they don't have faith in your ability to do the job and to keep them informed, you will not ship
  * De-risk by cancelling the project, or letting it roll out with zero attention or celebration, or go to another engineer
* Maintain trust by
  * Keeping a track record of having shipped things in the past
  * Project confidence
  * Project competence
  * Communicate professionally and concisely - don't make them chase you for updates, potentially posting a daily or weekly thread somewhere
* Ideally, should have at least 20% of your time free in the early stages of the project to communicate and identify solutions for potential problems
* Whatever you're building, put it in front of as many eyes as possible
* The best way to anticipate problems is to deploy early
* If to ship, that involves waiting on another team to make changes on their end, can the system be updated so that this is no longer a blocker?
* Build in fallback plans, especially emergency fallback plans
* You need to deploy as much as you can as early as possible, and you need to do the scariest changes as early as you can possibly do them
