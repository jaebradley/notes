# [Cannot Measure Productivity](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/CannotMeasureProductivity.html)

## LOC

* LOC is not a good measure of productivity, differences between languages, counting styles, differences due to formatting convention
* Can code the same stuff with huge variations in LOC, copy/paste leads to high LOC, but poor design
* LOC is pretty good at suggesting the size of a system (at the order of magnitude level)
* 100K LOC system is probably “bigger” than a 10K LOC system
* But if author X writes a 100K LOC system in Y period of time and author Z writes the same exact system in 10K LOC in Y period of time, that does not make author X more productive.
* Author X and author Z are probably equally productive, but author X’s system is more poorly designed

## Points

* If author X spends a year delivering a 100 point system, and author Y delivers a 50 point system does that mean that author X was more productive?
* It could be that of the 100 points, only 30% of the functionality was useful to the customer and 100% of author Y’s functionality was useful to the customer
* So author X’s “direct” productivity may be higher, but author Y’s “true” productivity is higher
* Even if author X produces more useful points, author Y’s lower amount of points might be tied to more revenue (“business value”) and thus author Y’s “true productivity” is higher
* While some people may be responsible for implementing features, others may play a supporting role where their contributions are that they are raising the whole team’s productivity, and it is hard to get a sense of their individual output (unless you are an IC on the team)
* Productivity boons in the early 00’s due to computer investments in the 90’s. Improvements lag investments.
