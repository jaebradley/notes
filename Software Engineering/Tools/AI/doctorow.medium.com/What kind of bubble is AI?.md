# [What kind of bubble is AI?](https://doctorow.medium.com/what-kind-of-bubble-is-ai-d02040b5573a)
* Author compare and contrasts bubbles 
  * Dot com bubble left an environment where raw materials like compute, bandwidth, and space were available at firesales prices
  * Crypto bubble, left behind digital art and a smattering of Rust programmers
  * Both bubbles lured nontechnical people into learning esoteric disciplines
* Worldcom vs. Enron is another comparison
  * Both were forms of fraud, but at least Worldcom put fiber into the ground that is used today
* Big Tech AI projects are very expensive
  * Fixed costs like collecting, labeling, and processing training data
  * Queries (and the servers they run on) are expensive, and specialized technical staff is expensive
* The issue with AI products is that, right now, most products need to be both high value and have high risk tolerance (i.e. how perfect does the product need to be)
  * Self-driving cars don't just need to create a better safety system for cars, they need to _replace_ human drivers
  * AI radiology analysis doesn't just need to be a cheap way of generating second opinions, it needs to _replace_ human radiologies
* The odds are stacked against the long-term survival of high-value, risk-intolerant AI applications
* There are a lot of risk-tolerant AI applications, but they're almost all low-value
  * Conversely, almost all high-value applications are risk-intolerant
* Small, "toy" models may persist even after the AI bubble bursts
* As big AI models get integrated into the process of productive economies, AI becomes a source of systemic risk
  * World becomes totally dependent on AI integration, only to have that AI infrastructure disappear
