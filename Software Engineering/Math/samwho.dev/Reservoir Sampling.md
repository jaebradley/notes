# [Reservoir Sampling](https://samwho.dev/reservoir-sampling/)

* How to randomly pick from a set of cards when only shown one card at a time?
  * Don't know how many cards are going to be shown
  * Can only hold on to one card at a time
  * Can't go back to a previous card
* Example: log service that sees burst traffic
