# [Operators `||` and `&&`](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/types%20%26%20grammar/ch4.md#operators--and-)

* The return value for `||` or `&&` will be one of the operands
* `||`
  * If the first operand is coerced to `true`, it is returned
  * If the first operand is coerced to `false`, the second operand is returned
  * It's roughly equivalent to `a ? a : b`
* `&&`
  * If the first operand is coerced to `true`, the second operand is returned
  * If the first operand is coerced to `false`, the first operand is returned
  * It's roughly equivalent to `a ? b : a`
