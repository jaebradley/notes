# Understanding your Network and its Configuration

## Network Basics

* Each machine connected to the network is called a host
* The hosts are connected to a router, which is a host that can move data from one network to another
* In the example, there are four hosts (Host A, Host B, Host C, and the Router) - these four hosts form a local area network (LAN)
* The router is also connected to the internet
 * Because the router is connected to both the LAN and the internet, all the machines on the LAN also have access to the internet through the router

### Packets

* A computer transmits data over a network in small chunks called packets
  * Packets consist of a header and a payload
  * The header contains identifying information like the origin/destination hosts and basic protool
  * The payload is the actual application data that the computer wants to send

## Network Layers

* Application layer contains the "language" that the applications and servers use to communicate - usually a high-level protocol like HTTP, SSL, FTP or some combination
* Transport layer defines the data transmission characteristics of the application layer
  * Data integrity checking, source and destination ports, specifications for breaking application data into packets
  * TCP and UDP are the most common transport layer protocols
* Network or Internet layer defines how to move packets from a source host to a destination host
* Physical layer defines how to send raw data across a physical medium

## The Internet Layer

* The Internet layer is meant to be a software network that places no particular requirements on hardware or operating system
  * The idea is that you can send and receive Internet packets over any kind of hardware using any operating system
* A host can be attached to more than one subnet (smaller network)
  * A router is a host that can transmit data from one subnet to another (routers are also called gateways)
* The router in previous example has two addresses - a local subnet address and an address to connect to the internet

### Subnets

* A subnet is a connected group of hosts with IP addresses in some sort of order
* A subnet is defined by a network prefix and a subnet mask
* A subnet containing IP addresses between 10.23.2.1 and 10.23.2.254 would have a network prefix of 10.23.2.0 (i.e. the part that is common to all addresses in the subnet) and a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0
  * The subnet mask is a value such that all possible subnet values are contained within the binary AND of the network prefix and the subnet mask

### ping

* `ping` sends Internet Control Message Protocol echo request packets to a host that ask a recipient host to return the packet to the sender
  * If the recipient host gets the packet and is configured to reply, it sends an ICMP echo response packet in return
* The output displays the sequence number and the round-trip time
* A gap in the sequence numbers usually means there's some kind of connectivity problem
  * It's possible for packets to arrive out of order, and if they do, there's some kind of problem because `ping` sends only one packet per second
* If a response takes more than a second to arrive, the connection is extremely slow
* The round-trip time is the total elapsed time between the moment that the request packet leaves and the moment that the response packet arrives

### DNS and host

* Use the `host` command to find the IP address behind a domain name
* Provides both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses

## The Physical Layer and Ethernet

* All devices on an Ethernet network have a Media Access Control (MAC) address or a hardware address
  * This address is independent of a host's IP address, and it is unique to the host's Ethernet network
* Devices on an Ethernet network send messages in frames, which are wrappers around the data sent
  * A frame contains the origin and destination MAC addresses
* If you have two different Ethernet networks with one host attached to both networks, you can't directly transmit a frame from one Ethernet network to the other unless you set up a special Ethernet bridge
  * Even though a frame can't leave one physical network, a router can take the data out of a frame, repackage it, and send it to a host on a different physical network

## Understanding Kernel Network Interfaces

* The Linux kernel maintains its own division between the two layer and provides communication standards for linking them called the kernel network interface
* When you configure a network interface, you like the IP address settings from the Internet side with the hardware identification on the physical device side

## The Transport Layer: TCP, UDP, and Services

* Transport layer protocols bridge the gap between the raw packets of the Internet layer and the refined needs of applications

### TCP Ports and Connections

* TCP provides for multiple network applications on one machine by means of network ports
* A port is just a number - if an IP address is like the postal address of an apartment building a port is like a mailbox number, it's a further subdivision
* When using TCP, an application opens a connection between one port on its own machine and a port on a remote host
  * An application such as a web browser could open a connection between port X on its own machine and port 80 on a remote host
  * Port X is the local port and port 80 is the remote port

### Internet Uplinks

* When the router has the third network interface with an Internet uplink, this same setup allows Internet access for all hosts on both subnets because they're configured to use ther router as a default gateway
*  certain IP addresses such as 10.23.2.4 are not actually visible to the whole Internet as they are reserved for private networks
* To provide for Internet connectivity, you must set up a feature called Network Address Translation on the router

## Private Networks

* Pick a small subnet like 10.23.2.0/24 (a class C subnet) for a private subnet
* Hosts on the real Internet know nothing about the private subnet and will not send packets to them, so without help, hosts on private subnets cannot talk to the outside world

## Network Address Translation (IP Masquerading)

* The router doesn't just move packets from one subnet to another - it also transforms them as it moves them
* Hosts on the Internet know how to connect to the router, but they know nothing about the private network behind it
* NAT works like
  * A host on the internal private network wants to make a connection to the outside world, so it sends its connection request packets through the router
  * The router intercepts the connection request packet rather than passing it out to the Internet
  * The router determines the destination of the conenction request packet and opens its own connection to the destination
  * When the router obtains the connection, it fakes a connection established message back to the original internal host
  * The router is now the middleman between the internal host and the destination - the destination knows nothing about the internal host, and the connection on the remote host looks like it came from the router
* Normal IP routing only knows the source and destination ip addresses in the internet layer
  * If router only dealt with the Internet layer, then each host on the internal network could establish only one connection to a single destination at a time because there is no information in the Internet layer part of a packet to distinguish multiple requests from the same host to the same destination
  * For example, the NAT dissects packets to identify things like UDP / TCP port numbers from the transport layers

## Firewalls

* A firewall is a software and/or hardware configuration that usually sits on a router between the internet and a smaller network, attempting to ensure that nothing "bad" from the Internet harms the smaller network
* A system can filter packets when it
  * Receives a packet
  * Sends a packet
  * Forwards a packet to another host or gateway
  * Packets are analyzed based on source / destination IP address or subnet, source or destination port

## Ethernet, IP, and ARP

* A host must place an IP packet inside an Ethernet frame in order to transmit the packet across the physical layer to another host
* Frames themselves do not include IP address information, they use MAC (hardware) addresses
* Networking software uses an automatic system that looks up MAC addresses using Address Resolution Protocol
* A host using Ethernet as its physical layer and IP as the network layer maintains a small table called an ARP cache that maps IP addresses to MAC addresses
* When a machine wants to send a packet to another host and the target IP address is not in an ARP cache
  * The origin host creates a special Ethernet frame containing an ARP request packet for the MAC address that corresponds to the target IP address
  * The origin host broadcasts this frame to the entire physical network for the target's subnet
  * If one of the other hosts on the subnet knows the correct MAC address, it creates a reply packet and frame containing the address and sends it back to the origin. Often, the host that replies is the target host and is simply replying with its own MAC address
  * The origin host adds the IP/MAC address pair to the ARP cache and can proceed
