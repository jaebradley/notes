# Chapter 2. Basic Commands and Directory Hierarchy

## Using the Shell

### Standard Input and Standard Output

* Unix processes use I/O streams to read and write data (processes read data from input streams and write data to output streams)
  * The source of an input stream can be a file, a device, a terminal, or even the output stream from another process
* The `cat` command specified without any arguments reads from the standard input stream provided by the Linux kernel - if executed in a terminal, the standard input would be conencted to the terminal that executed cat
* The kernel gives each process and standard output stream where it can write its output
  * Since the `cat` command always writes to standard output, running `cat` in the terminal will output the output to the terminal

## Intermediate Commands

* `file` - the command parses a file and describes its format
* `find` - `find some_dir -name some_filefile -print`
  * Find a file within a directory tree
  * `find` takes pattern-matching characters
* `sort` - sorts lines of files in alphanumeric order
  * If the file's lines start with numbers, use the `-n` option
  * `-r` reverses the order

## Environment and Shell Variables

* An environment variable is like a shell variable but its not specific to the shell
* All processes on Unix systems have environment variable storage
* The main difference between environment and shell variables is that the operating system passes all of your shell's environment variables to programs that the shell runs, whereas shell variables cannot be accessed in the commands that you run
* Can use the `export` command to assigne an environment variable

## The Command Path

* `PATH` is a special environment variable that contains the command path
* The command path is a list of system directories that the shell searches when trying to locate a command
  * The shell seaerches the directories listed in the `PATH` environment variables for the `ls` program
* If programs with the same name appear in several directories in the path, the shell runs the first matching program
* To tell the shell to look in more places for programs add directory `dir` to the beginning of the path like `PATH=dir:$PATH` so that the shell looks in `dir` before looking in any of the other `PATH` directories

## Command-Line Editing

* `CTRL + P` - view the previous command
* `CTRL + N` - view the next command
* `CTRL + W` - erase the preceding word
* `CTRL + U` - erase from cursor to beginning of the line
* `CTRL + K` - erase from cursor to end of the line
* `CTRL + Y` - paste erased text

## Getting Online Help

* `man -k some_keyword` - search for a manual page by keyword

## Shell Input and Output

* To send the output of a command to a file, use the `>` redirection character
  * `command > file`
  * The shell creates `file` if it does not already exist
  * If `file` exists, the shell erases the original file first
* To append instead of overwriting, use the `>>` redirection charactes
* To send the standard output of a command to the standard input of another command, use the pipe character

### Standard Error

* Standard error is an additional output stream for diagnostics and debugging
* To send standard output to `f` and standard error to `e` use the `2>` syntax like `some_command > f 2> e`
* The number `2` defines the stream ID that the shell modifies
  * Stream ID `1` is standard output and Stream ID `2` is standard error
* `2>&1` sends standard error to the same location as standard output

### Standard Input Redirection

* `<` operator like `head < some_file`

## Listing and Manipulating Processes

* Each process has a numeric process id
* To see all the running processes, call the `ps` program
  * `ps` displays the process ID, the terminal device where the process is running, the process status, the CPU time that the process has been used for, and the command associated with the process

### Command Options

* `ps x` - show all of your running processes
* `ps ax` - show all processes on the system, not just the ones you own
* `ps u` - include more detailed information on processes
* `ps w` - show full command names, not just what fits on one line
* To check on a specific process, add its PID to the argument list of the `ps` command

### Background Processes

* You can detach a process from the shell and put it in the background with the `&`, like `some_command_that_will_take_a_while &`
* The shell prints the PID of the background process
* The process will continue after you log out
* Use `fg` to bring the program to the foreground
* If the program writes to standard output, the output can appear in the terminal window with no regard for anything else running there
* Ensure that background processes redirect its output

## Archiving and Compressing Files

### tar

* To create an archive of files (i.e. to pack multiple files and directores into one file), use the `tar` program
* `tar cvf some_archive_name.tar file1 file2 ...`
  * The `c` flag activates create mode
  * The `v` flag activates verbose diagnostic output - adding another `v` (i.e. two `v`s causes `tar` to print details such as file size and permissions)
  * The `f` flag denotes the file option
    * The argument after the `f` flag must be the archive file for `tar` to create. This must be a filename unless using standard input or output, then enter a `-`
* To unpack a `tar` file use the `x` (extract) flag like `tar xvj some_archive.tar`
  * Possible to extract individual parts of the archive by entering the names of the parts at the end of the command line
  * `tar` won't remove the archived `tar` file after extracting its contents
  * Use the `p` flag to preserve permissions
* To check the contents of an archive before unpacking, can use the table-of-contents mode by using the `t` flag instead of the `x` flag
  * Verifies the archive's basic integrity and prints the names of all the files inside

### zcat

* Calling `gunzip` first and then `tar` is not the fastest / efficient way of calling `tar` on a compressed archive
* Instead use a pipeline where `zcat` is equivalent to `gunzip -dc` (the `-d` option decompresses and the `-c` option sends the result to standard output)
  * So can do something like `zcat file.tar.gz | tar.xvf -`
* The version of tar that comes with Linux has a shortcut - can use `z` as an option to automatically invoke `gzip` on the archive both on extraction and creation

## Linux Directory Hierarchy Essentials

* `/bin` - contains programs / executables including most of the basic Unix commands. Most of the programs are in binary format, created by a C compiler, but there are some shell scripts
* `/dev` - contains device files
* `/etc` - contains the core system configuration directory
* `/home` - contains the personal directories for regular users
* `/lib` - contains library files containing code that executables can use
* `/proc` - contains information about currently running processes
* `/sbin` - contains programs related to system management

## The /usr Directory

* `/usr` is where most of the ser-space programs and data reside
* `/usr/local` is where administrators can install their own software
* `/man` contains manual pages
