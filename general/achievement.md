* [The 9 Facts of Life](https://psiloveyou.xyz/the-9-facts-of-life-90e26ada3abb)
  * How many days of your life did you spend being angry at somebody for something you didn't agree with? What did it solve?
  * You cannot be valuable if you don't understand what other people value
    * > Most people get things backward. They spend all day thinking about what they want to do in their life and then get frustrated when nothing pans out. What they should be doing is listening to the people around them and taking the time to identify how their strengths can help people to overcome their weaknesses.
