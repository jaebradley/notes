## [The 9 Facts of Life](https://psiloveyou.xyz/the-9-facts-of-life-90e26ada3abb)

* How many days of your life did you spend being angry at somebody for something you didn't agree with? What did it solve?
* You cannot be valuable if you don't understand what other people value
  * > Most people get things backward. They spend all day thinking about what they want to do in their life and then get frustrated when nothing pans out. What they should be doing is listening to the people around them and taking the time to identify how their strengths can help people to overcome their weaknesses.

* Success is just a figment of your imagination that mostly serves your ego and causes pain when you don't get what you want

## [4 Habits That Will Dramatically Improve Your Productivity](https://medium.com/personal-growth/4-habits-that-will-dramatically-improve-your-productivity-6c451f55f71)

* Often the people who struggle the most with procrastination have harsh, judgemental beliefs about what it means to even _feel_ like procrastinating - these beliefs express themselvees in a form of negative self-talk ("what's wrong with me - why can't I just get my shit together and focus")
  * Now the urge to procrastinate is even stronger because distracting yourself with cheap pleasure / entertaining is a quick way to avoid negative feelings that come with nasty self-talk
* Losing focus doesn't necessarily mean willpower muscle is weak - it may mean that environmental distractions are strong
* 4:55 drill - at end of each workday, take 5 minutes to get organized for following day
  * Decide on one or two things you'd like to accomplish first thing and assemble everything you need now so can hit ground running
* Before start working, close down every application, window, etc. except for things that are absolutely essential to work
* Track deep work progress - marking days off on calendar and trying not to "break the chain"
