## [The 9 Facts of Life](https://psiloveyou.xyz/the-9-facts-of-life-90e26ada3abb)

* How many days of your life did you spend being angry at somebody for something you didn't agree with? What did it solve?
* You cannot be valuable if you don't understand what other people value
  * > Most people get things backward. They spend all day thinking about what they want to do in their life and then get frustrated when nothing pans out. What they should be doing is listening to the people around them and taking the time to identify how their strengths can help people to overcome their weaknesses.

## [4 Habits That Will Dramatically Improve Your Productivity](https://medium.com/personal-growth/4-habits-that-will-dramatically-improve-your-productivity-6c451f55f71)

* Often the people who struggle the most with procrastination have harsh, judgemental beliefs about what it means to even _feel_ like procrastinating - these beliefs express themselvees in a form of negative self-talk ("what's wrong with me - why can't I just get my shit together and focus")
  * Now the urge to procrastinate is even stronger because distracting yourself with cheap pleasure / entertaining is a quick way to avoid negative feelings that come with nasty self-talk
* Losing focus doesn't necessarily mean willpower muscle is weak - it may mean that environmental distractions are strong
* 4:55 drill - at end of each workday, take 5 minutes to get organized for following day
  * Decide on one or two things you'd like to accomplish first thing and assemble everything you need now so can hit ground running
* Before start working, close down every application, window, etc. except for things that are absolutely essential to work
* Track deep work progress - marking days off on calendar and trying not to "break the chain"

* Scheduling Deep Work blocks into your calendar in advance takes away the need to use willpower
* Focus on the widly important - having a small number of really critical goals returns tangible and substantial professional benefits that will generate a steadier stream of enthusiasm
* Clear to Neutral - at the end of the day, close all tabs, programs, delete or move all files from Downloads, empty trash and shut off computer
* Evening work is usually not important - work that you fit into your downtime isn't normally high-value activities that advance career

* In the absence of clear indicators of what it means to be productive and valuable many knowledge workers turn back to an industrial indicator of productivity (i.e. doing stuff in a visible manner)
* Fixed schedule productivity - set a fixed limit until when to work and then work backwards to figure out how to achieve that goal (saying "no" to anything that will be a distraction) and then stick to deadline
* Four hours a day, if they are truly focused, spent on the right things, and supported by good rest, are really all it needs to achieve great things
* Many consider work (9-5) as the day - but instead treat leisure time as day within the day
* Detachment, the ability to put work completely out of our mind and attend to other things, is tremendously important for physical and mental recovery
