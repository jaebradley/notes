# [Rocket League and root cause misattribution](https://www.zeptonaut.com/posts/rocket-league-and-root-cause-misattribution/)

* Author is bad at Rocket League, especially "finesse" plays
* Author tried out drills, but found a steeper learning curve and minimal progress
* Author found video that explained that competitors at the author's skill level tend to overchase the ball
  * Overchasing leads to being too close to the ball to play well and decreases their ability to defend their goal
* Author stayed further away from the ball, and noticed an immediate improvement in contributions
* Instead of having to make finesse plays in tight spaces, plenty of time and space to make easy shots because no one was near them
* "get better at making tricky plays" -> "position yourself better so that you don't have to make tricky plays"
* Dead obvious problems can all be second order effects of more distant problems
  * Temping to think that the only way to address a problem is by fixing its most proximal manifestation
