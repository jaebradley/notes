## [The Relentless Pursuit of Nothing](https://psiloveyou.xyz/the-relentless-pursuit-of-nothing-ee7e43f2f427)

* The root of an attachment pathology is a condition of feeling like we have too much or too little of what we need, stemming from lack of self-worth (anxiety) or extreme distaste / contempt of others (avoidance)
* Americans tie themselves to ambition and achievement - to make goals _tangible_ as this serves as the barometer of self-worth
* Feeling like one needs to be an all-star to just stay in the league is an anxious attachment disorder with achievement
* What do you want to suffer for?
* Questions should not include a `when` - timelines are arbitrary as there is no proper order when it comes to being enough or being who you were meant to become
* Overthinking is usually symptom of anxious attachment
* Create the optimal UX for yourself

## [How to Become Emotionally Self-Sufficient](https://psiloveyou.xyz/how-to-become-emotionally-self-sufficient-b6c429ba4e26)

* It's easy to gloss over negative emotions and "try to stay positive" as we're often told - we may think we've handled our sadness, fear, or disappointment when, actually, we haven't even identified which one causes our discomfort
* You can't write without structuring your thoughts, and since your thoughts are your responses to your emotions, writing is structuring your emotional responses
* Meditation is humility in its purest form - you just sit there. You don't act. You don't think. You just allow yourself to merely exist and you teach yourself that that's actually ok

## [Beyond Insecurity: The Positive Power of the Right Kind of Ambition](https://medium.com/personal-growth/beyond-insecurity-the-positive-power-of-the-right-kind-of-ambition-f98504d6c0d7)

* If we look at the world around us, some of the most insidious and damaging things are caused by ambition
* Generally, anyone who makes themselves the judge of good and evil at the expense of some other side is probably not the best person to make that judgement
* There is a big, but subtle, difference between ambition driven by insecurity and ambition driven by the desire to self-actualize.
  * The former is born out of not feeling enough - its source is either self-hate, or self-disrespect.
  * The latter is simply an affirmation of life - an attempt to do the most that one can do with the body one has been given
  * It doesn't compete with others, but with itself
* Anytime you make it your goal to make as much money as someone else, you are disrespecting yourself and your individuality, unconsciously telling yourself that you, yourself, are not a person worthy of respect,  so you must seek it by imitating others
* True achievement / ambition isn't really about better or worse, but about becoming different - it's about novelty and interestingness and growth, all of which are nonlinear

## [The Paradox of Life: How to Both Accept Yourself and Change Yourself](https://medium.com/@jeffreylam/the-paradox-of-life-how-to-both-accept-yourself-and-change-yourself-4b993d87eb2a)

* Radical Acceptance rests on letting go of the illusion of control and a willingness to notice and accept things as they are right now, without judging
* Once the piece falls down the screen, the piece cannot be changed
  * Instead of getting mad at the Tetris gods, or passively accepting the situation, focus on placing the piece in the best place
* Radical Acceptance facilitates change because the sooner you unconditionally accept the situation for what it is, the sooner you can make a decision about the best place to put the piece
* The curious paradox is that when I accept myself just as I am, then I can change

## [Alone Time Is Essential to a Healthy Social Life](https://forge.medium.com/alone-time-is-essential-to-a-healthy-social-life-a88e475db5a0)

* The best interactions make us feel very connected but don't take a lot of effort like hanging out with your best friend - a nourishing social interaction
* Other factors include level of closeness felt with people you see regularly, what is talked about (mix of deep and surface-level conversations are best), and choice in who you interact with and when
* Most surprising factor is solitude - when you're alone and content, that's a great indicator that you're socially healthy
  * When people had a nourishing interaction early in the day, they were even more likely to be happily alone later

## [7 Signs You Have An Unhealthy Relationship With Your Emotions](https://medium.com/mind-cafe/7-signs-you-have-an-unhealthy-relationship-with-your-emotions-1120f1648e2a)## [Alone Time Is Essential to a Healthy Social Life](https://forge.medium.com/alone-time-is-essential-to-a-healthy-social-life-a88e475db5a0)

* Intellectualizing feelings like saying "I'm just a little wound up" vs. "I'm pretty anxious"
  * Describing how you feel emotionally in terms of conceptual ideas or metaphors rather than plain emotional words
  * Used as a defense mechanism to avoid being as vulnerable by describing how one feels using plain emotional language
* If you want to develop a happier, healthier relationship with your emotions, remind yourself that just because a particular feeling feels bad, that doesn't mean it is bad or that you experiencing it is a bad sign
* How we habitually think (and talk) determines how we habitually feel (obvious sign that relationship with emotions needs work is if inner narrator is a jerk)
* Like most addictions, reassurance-seeking is a trade-off of our long-term happiness and health for short-term comfort and ease
* A lot of us beleive that we need to feel good or motivated or confident in order to do something difficult but motivation and confidence are feelings that result from doing worthwhile things - they're an effect, not a prerequisite
* The healthier view is to learn through experience that it's perfectly possible to do difficult things while feeling anxious or embarrassed or angry

## [5 Fresh Habit for a Calm and Peaceful Mind](https://medium.com/personal-growth/5-fresh-habits-for-a-calm-and-peaceful-mind-47faf38dcc40)

* In it's simplest form, mindfulness just means keeping your attention in the present rather than the past or future
* Expectations contain the illusion of control, hopes do not
  * When you expect that something will happen, you're counting on it - you believe with some certainty (but the vast majority of the time, this degree of certainty about the future is unwarranted)
  * We pretend to understand what's going to happen because it lessens our anxiety about the future
  * Hope implies that you don't have control or much certainty about the outcome - it's simply an expression of desire without any illusions of control or certainty
* Schedule worry means you create a consistent time each day to worry on purpose and on paper
  * Write down every worry, concern, or fear
  * If there are still worries, just tell yourself you'll get to them tomorrow
* From a young age, most of us are trained to beleive that in order to be successful, productive members of socieity, we have to be hard on ourselves
* You can't have a peaceful mind if your mind is always attacking you, and you're always attacking it back
* Treat yourself like you would treat a good friend
* Self-compassion diary - jot down things in the day that didn't go so well
  * Imagine if a friend told it to you and how you'd respond and write that down underneat
* One of the best ways to cultivate a more peaceful mind is to close the gap between what you want and what you're actually doing
