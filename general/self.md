## [The Relentless Pursuit of Nothing](https://psiloveyou.xyz/the-relentless-pursuit-of-nothing-ee7e43f2f427)

* The root of an attachment pathology is a condition of feeling like we have too much or too little of what we need, stemming from lack of self-worth (anxiety) or extreme distaste / contempt of others (avoidance)
* Americans tie themselves to ambition and achievement - to make goals _tangible_ as this serves as the barometer of self-worth
* Feeling like one needs to be an all-star to just stay in the league is an anxious attachment disorder with achievement
* What do you want to suffer for?
* Questions should not include a `when` - timelines are arbitrary as there is no proper order when it comes to being enough or being who you were meant to become
* Overthinking is usually symptom of anxious attachment
* Create the optimal UX for yourself

## [How to Become Emotionally Self-Sufficient](https://psiloveyou.xyz/how-to-become-emotionally-self-sufficient-b6c429ba4e26)

* It's easy to gloss over negative emotions and "try to stay positive" as we're often told - we may think we've handled our sadness, fear, or disappointment when, actually, we haven't even identified which one causes our discomfort
* You can't write without structuring your thoughts, and since your thoughts are your responses to your emotions, writing is structuring your emotional responses

## [Beyond Insecurity: The Positive Power of the Right Kind of Ambition](https://medium.com/personal-growth/beyond-insecurity-the-positive-power-of-the-right-kind-of-ambition-f98504d6c0d7)

* If we look at the world around us, some of the most insidious and damaging things are caused by ambition
* Generally, anyone who makes themselves the judge of good and evil at the expense of some other side is probably not the best person to make that judgement
* There is a big, but subtle, difference between ambition driven by insecurity and ambition driven by the desire to self-actualize.
  * The former is born out of not feeling enough - its source is either self-hate, or self-disrespect.
  * The latter is simply an affirmation of life - an attempt to do the most that one can do with the body one has been given
  * It doesn't compete with others, but with itself
* Anytime you make it your goal to make as much money as someone else, you are disrespecting yourself and your individuality, unconsciously telling yourself that you, yourself, are not a person worthy of respect,  so you must seek it by imitating others
* True achievement / ambition isn't really about better or worse, but about becoming different - it's about novelty and interestingness and growth, all of which are nonlinear
