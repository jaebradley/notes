## [The Relentless Pursuit of Nothing](https://psiloveyou.xyz/the-relentless-pursuit-of-nothing-ee7e43f2f427)

* Feeling like one needs to be an all-star to just stay in the league is an anxious attachment disorder with achievement
* What do you want to suffer for?

* Overthinking is usually symptom of anxious attachment
* Create the optimal UX for yourself

* You can't write without structuring your thoughts, and since your thoughts are your responses to your emotions, writing is structuring your emotional responses

## [Beyond Insecurity: The Positive Power of the Right Kind of Ambition](https://medium.com/personal-growth/beyond-insecurity-the-positive-power-of-the-right-kind-of-ambition-f98504d6c0d7)

* If we look at the world around us, some of the most insidious and damaging things are caused by ambition
* Generally, anyone who makes themselves the judge of good and evil at the expense of some other side is probably not the best person to make that judgement
* There is a big, but subtle, difference between ambition driven by insecurity and ambition driven by the desire to self-actualize.
  * The former is born out of not feeling enough - its source is either self-hate, or self-disrespect.
  * The latter is simply an affirmation of life - an attempt to do the most that one can do with the body one has been given
  * It doesn't compete with others, but with itself
* Anytime you make it your goal to make as much money as someone else, you are disrespecting yourself and your individuality, unconsciously telling yourself that you, yourself, are not a person worthy of respect,  so you must seek it by imitating others
* True achievement / ambition isn't really about better or worse, but about becoming different - it's about novelty and interestingness and growth, all of which are nonlinear

## [The Paradox of Life: How to Both Accept Yourself and Change Yourself](https://medium.com/@jeffreylam/the-paradox-of-life-how-to-both-accept-yourself-and-change-yourself-4b993d87eb2a)

* Radical Acceptance rests on letting go of the illusion of control and a willingness to notice and accept things as they are right now, without judging
* Once the piece falls down the screen, the piece cannot be changed
  * Instead of getting mad at the Tetris gods, or passively accepting the situation, focus on placing the piece in the best place
* Radical Acceptance facilitates change because the sooner you unconditionally accept the situation for what it is, the sooner you can make a decision about the best place to put the piece
* The curious paradox is that when I accept myself just as I am, then I can change

* Most surprising factor is solitude - when you're alone and content, that's a great indicator that you're socially healthy

* How we habitually think (and talk) determines how we habitually feel (obvious sign that relationship with emotions needs work is if inner narrator is a jerk)
* Like most addictions, reassurance-seeking is a trade-off of our long-term happiness and health for short-term comfort and ease
* A lot of us beleive that we need to feel good or motivated or confident in order to do something difficult but motivation and confidence are feelings that result from doing worthwhile things - they're an effect, not a prerequisite
* The healthier view is to learn through experience that it's perfectly possible to do difficult things while feeling anxious or embarrassed or angry

* Expectations contain the illusion of control, hopes do not
  * When you expect that something will happen, you're counting on it - you believe with some certainty (but the vast majority of the time, this degree of certainty about the future is unwarranted)
  * We pretend to understand what's going to happen because it lessens our anxiety about the future
  * Hope implies that you don't have control or much certainty about the outcome - it's simply an expression of desire without any illusions of control or certainty
* Schedule worry means you create a consistent time each day to worry on purpose and on paper
  * Write down every worry, concern, or fear
  * If there are still worries, just tell yourself you'll get to them tomorrow
* From a young age, most of us are trained to beleive that in order to be successful, productive members of socieity, we have to be hard on ourselves
* You can't have a peaceful mind if your mind is always attacking you, and you're always attacking it back
* Treat yourself like you would treat a good friend
* Self-compassion diary - jot down things in the day that didn't go so well

## [If Self-Love is Hard, Just Focus on Liking Yourself](https://blog.onlywomen.com/if-self-love-is-hard-just-focus-on-liking-yourself-1b8fefd26866)

* Accepting that where you are right now is okay is incredibly powerful and an integral part of learning to like yourself. You don't have to love where you are; you just have to be okay with it as a starting point.
* Accept yourself as a whole person, and accept without criticism. This does mean accepting things as "flaws" or "darkness" - on the contrary, compassion means acceptance without casting judgement. There is no "flaw" or "darkness" - your anxieties, insecurities, doubts, disgust, disappointment, envy - none of it is bad. It just _is_. And self-love means you regard it without judgement.

* Create a ritual, embrace your spirituality, practice mindfulness, get intentional, be gentle to yourself, ask your spiritual guide for help, love your body, develop relationships with healers, know your truths
* If the love for yourself that you show is sub-optimal or self-destructive, it's not because you don't love yourself enough, or haven't awakened the spirit within you. It's because you probably haven't seen a healthy regard for your well-being or happiness modeled for you, and that probably stems from buried trauma, or a toxic relationship with your primary caregiver. You can only love yourself in the way you've been shown.

## [Self-Love Isn't About Affirmations](https://medium.com/@krisgage/self-love-isnt-about-affirmations-4cd09ae1d60f)

* If you are regularly sabotaging your long-term happiness, you do not love yourself. No matter how often you tell yourself otherwise.
* Self-love isn't just about what you tell yourself to make yourself feel better - it's about what you do to make yourself be better
* The more hard work you put into bettering your life, the less often you'll feel the need to treat yourself. To affirm yourself. To remind yourself that you're worthy - because you're already proving these things to yourself through your actions, every single day.

## [Buddha on Worrying](https://medium.com/the-ascent/buddha-on-worrying-7509829c8bbe)

* If you can solve the problem, then what is the need of worrying? If you cannot solve it, then what is the use of worrying?
* Since we see everything as solid and permanent, we tend to take life seriously and make a big deal out of problems. Consequently, we become attached to our life’s situations and worry about them. It is because of our ignorance that we worry about things.
* Certain friendships are toxic, but give it a chance. Or certain food / drink / drugs are not good for you, but you consume them anyways.The fact that we ignore these things, leads to suffering i.e. ignorance leads to suffering.
* we worry because we need to be able to predict what is lying ahead
* We don’t want to be wrong or uncertain about anything, so we start peaking and overanalyzing things too much, which causes worrying and distress.
* And it suddenly occurred to me that the word ‘present’ also means ‘gift’. The gift of the present moment, the now. Essentially the only thing we really possess. Because the past and the future are only concepts existing in our own minds. It is in the present moment where we live, where we are happy, where we create our future. And if we decide to use our precious moment to worry, then that is by our own choice and making.
* God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference.
