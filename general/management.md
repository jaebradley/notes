# Management

* Consequence vs. Conviction
  * > [Where there is low consequence and you have very low confidence in your own opinion, you should absolutely delegate. And delegate completely, let people make mistakes and learn. On the other side, obviously where the consequences are dramatic and you have extremely high conviction that you are right, you actually can't let your junior colleague make a mistake](https://medium.com/@yegg/mental-models-i-find-repeatedly-useful-936f1cc405d)
* Hindsight Bias
  > [The inclination, after an event has occurred, to see the event as having been predictable, despite there having been little or no objective basis for predicting it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindsight_bias)
