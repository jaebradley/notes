# Management

* Consequence vs. Conviction
  * > [Where there is low consequence and you have very low confidence in your own opinion, you should absolutely delegate. And delegate completely, let people make mistakes and learn. On the other side, obviously where the consequences are dramatic and you have extremely high conviction that you are right, you actually can't let your junior colleague make a mistake](https://medium.com/@yegg/mental-models-i-find-repeatedly-useful-936f1cc405d)
* Hindsight Bias
  > [The inclination, after an event has occurred, to see the event as having been predictable, despite there having been little or no objective basis for predicting it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindsight_bias)

## [The Tom Brady Principle: Don't Promote Your Best People](https://medium.com/betterworkingworld/the-tom-brady-principle-dont-promote-your-best-people-e924fa308550)

* Human performance followed the power law - high performers are not only one or two standard deviations above average - they have dramatically higher levels of impact than average performers
* We are requiring today's leaders to be the best player on the team, the coach, the general manager, and CEO
  * Instead of attracting people that want to lead and inspire, end up attrac\\ting people motivated by money / power / status
* Authority does not equal performance and being promoted is not always the best way to unlock creativity and innovation

## [Focus on Productivity, Not Efficiency](https://medium.com/swlh/focus-on-productivity-not-efficiency-4ed4fe9a454f)

* Without top-line growth, continuing to wring out greater profits through efficiency has become the managerial equivalent of attempting to squeeze blood from a stone
* While efficiency is about doing more with less, productivity is about doing more with the same
