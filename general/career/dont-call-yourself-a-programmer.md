# [Don't Call Yourself A Programmer](https://www.kalzumeus.com/2011/10/28/dont-call-yourself-a-programmer/)

* Most software is boring one-off applications in corporations - it solves business problems
  * It can solve business problems despite being soul-crushingly boring and of minimal technical complexity
  * It only matters if it either saves company costs or generates additional revenue
* Status in well-run business generally is awarded to people who successfully take credit for either increasing revenue or reducing costs (regardless of it it entails them actually doing those things)
  * Producing beautiful software is not the goal, solving complex technical problems is not the goal, writing bug-free code is not the goal - add revenue and / or reduce costs
* There are profit centers, which make a firm money and then there are cost centers, which are everybody else
  * You want to be attached to profit centers, because it will bring you higher wages / respect / opportunities
    * If you can't work in a profit center at a company, work elsewhere or engineer your transfer to a profit center after joining the company
* Don't call yourself a programmer - describe yourself by what you have accomplished for previous employers around increasing revenues or reducing costs (for example "wrote the backend billing code that 97% of Google's revenue passes through")
* At a job interview, remember that you both are within the confines of a transaction - you are not their friend, you're an input for an industrial process which they are trying to buy for the company at the lowest price
* Most jobs are never available publicly, just like most worthwhile candidates are not available publicly
  * Word of mouth => introductions => meetings => job offer => then resume / HR / formal offer dance begins
  * This is disproportionally true of jobs you actually want
* Don't want to be first employee of startup - be last co-founder
* The question is not "how much money do engineers make" but "what kind of offers do engineers routinely work for?"
  * Salary is only one of the many levers that people use to motivate other people
* Be comfortable counteroffering around axes you care about other than money - if they can't go higher on salary, then talk about vacation instead
* Working at a startup, you tend to meet people doing startups
  * Most of them will not be able to hire you in two years
  * Working at a large corportation, you tend to meet other people in large corporations where many of them will either be able to hire you or will have the ear of someone able to hire you in two years
  * Working in a startup is a career path, but more than that, a lifestyle choice like working in investment banking or academia
* If getting stuff done is your job description, then convincing people to get stuff done is a core job skill
  * Be able to communicate effectively in memos, emails, conversations, meetings, etc.
  * It means knowing that sometimes you will make technological sacrifices in pursuit of business objectives and that this is the right call
