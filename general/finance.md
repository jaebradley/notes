## [The Sad Reason The Housing Market Is Booming During A Recession](https://medium.com/makingofamillionaire/the-sad-reason-the-housing-market-is-booming-during-a-recession-294242066c4f)

* Workers in the bottom 25% of earnings made up half of the job losses during the recession
  * However, the demand for houses from this particular sector of the market should be low - low-income earners can't afford to buy houses anyways; they rent
  * Low-income earners are also less-likely to have money invested in the stock market, so they have probably not benefited in rebound in asset prices
* Fiscal stimulus + rock-bottom interest rates mean that high income earners have been bidding up the price of houses
* If the government sends me a check, it is 100% getting invested in the stock market - because I don't need the money right now
