# [Conversation Skills Essentials](https://tynan.com/letstalk/)

## Accept, Don't Seek

* Accept whatever reaction someone gives you, and treat it as though it were correct
  * If you said something hilarious and they didn’t laugh, act as if it wasn’t funny
  * Either it wasn’t, or they didn’t pick up on it, but in either case trying to get them to laugh will make them feel uncomfortable

## Gauge Interest

* When broaching a topic (the author uses an example of building a pinball machine) give the listener the option to exit the conversation
* Absolves the listener of pressure to continue discussing a topic that they are not interested in

## Ask Questions

* The worst conversations are those where both parties are waiting their turn to talk, saying as much as they can before getting interrupted, and then being forced to listen to the other

## Verbalize when you change your mind

* When someone has taught you something or changed your mind on something, let them know
* "You know, I used to really think X, but you’ve convinced me Y"

## Disagree Positively

* Author uses example of somebody saying they live in Vegas and another person doesn't like living in Vegas
* Positive disagreement would be something like “Vegas? Casinos and desert? What made you choose that?”
* Another example: “I believe X, but I bet you believe Y and you always have interesting takes, so I’d love to hear your thoughts”

## Benchmarking

* Notice single world answers ("nice", "cool", "ok")
* Conversations should be just about 50/50 in terms of talk time, and topic introduction
