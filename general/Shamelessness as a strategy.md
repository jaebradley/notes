# [Shamelessness as a strategy](https://nadia.xyz/shameless)

* Game called Avalon (like Werewolf) where one team is trying to uncover evil team, before the evil team wins
* Merlin knows who evil players are, but can't reveal what he knows because evil team can kill Merlin and win the game
  * Merlin relies on Percival to be his decoy, where the typical strategy is for Percival to attract attention away from Merlin and towards himself
  * Another strategy is for Merlin to play as though _he_ is Percival, and display what he knows so shamelessly that he throws everyone off
    * In this case, Merlin needs the other players to feel unsure about whether he's being incredibly stupid or incredibly smart
* This "shameless" approach is becoming a dominant strategy in today's society
* First popularized by Paris Hilton, and became playbook for Kardashians etc
  * People were dismissive of Paris Hilton because validating her playbook would mean admitting that they were playing an inferior game
* Leadership styles of Mark Zuckerberg vs. Jack Dorsey or pre-2016 election playbook vs. post-2016 election playbook
* Shameless strategy feels counterintuitive, because first instinct is to punsh such behavior
  * Punishing outlandish behavior is an important aspect of cooperative governane since it preserves social order by ensuring that we all play by the same rules
* Today, it seems like punishing shamelessness only _increases_ social rewards to the transgressor
  * One explanation is that social communities are no longer finitely bounded (like a village) and people enter / exit communities with more frequency than in the past
  * With open borders, sanctions act as a signalling boost for the transgressor, attracting outsiders who resonate with that person's message
* The "establishment" assumes that a shameless person wants the approval of their community, but that person's goal was to attract a following, regardless of who the members are
  * Disgust of one's peers don't matter anymore, because that disgust forms the basis for an entirely new community
* A shameless person is simply a host for a set of ideas, which, like any virus, will continue to propagate as long as there are willing hosts to receive it
