# [When We Don't Know What We Want](https://medium.com/personal-growth/when-we-dont-know-what-we-want-48b237491bf0)

* Stop demanding an answer to "what you want"
* Brainstorm ideas doesn't work - it's like dragging an anorexic to a buffet thinking that'll solve the problem
* "Just do it!" doesn't work - feels panicked and forced; we're liable to jump blindly at the next thing or *anything*
* We aren't always equipped with the answer because we aren't always equipped with the instinct
* We make decisions because we want it or because others want it - so if we don't know what we want, it's because we've silenced ourselves
* All of it is first ours to resolve - if we have any hope of being able to answer "what do you want", we have to do this for ourselves first
* I sat with meditation in the way we visit relatives we don't like: out of obligation, smiling to hide our discomfort - as much from ourselves as them - each moment dragging on (and us along with it)
* Every time I gave my attention to anything besides myself, I was actually telling myself "this random thought is more important than you are"
* On the flip side, every time I brought my attention back to myself, I was also saying "you are most important right now"
* When we feel we don't "want" to do something we know we "should" do, it's a siren in our ear.
  * The solution isn't to force ourselves, crying or kicking and screaming or terrified, but to pause, give attention, resolve
  * The solution also isn't to "just take action" or look to others - it's also not avoiding our feelings or dumping them on people
  * If we don't know what our needs are, our job is to sit quietly with ourselves, be present and aware, and rebuid from bottom, with whatever is handed to us
