# [35 Things You Need to Give Up to Be Successful](https://journal.thriveglobal.com/35-things-you-need-to-give-up-to-be-successful-c07c326aec31)

1. Wasting Five Minutes
  * If we have 5 five-minute breaks per day => 25 minutes daily => 9,125 minutes yearly
2. Not Valuing One Dollar
  * Understanding the value of one dollar is the same as coming to appreciate the value of time
  * It also reflects a lack of care about the details, which is where the true art and value lies
3. Believing Success Will Make You Happy
  * `We buy things to make us happy, and we succeed. But only for a while. New things are exciting to us at first, but then we adapt to them`
  * Until you appreciate what you currently have, more won't make your life better
4. Believing You're Not Up For The Challenge
  * The longer you procrastinate or avoid doing something, the more painful (in your head) it becomes. However, once you take action, the discomfort is far less sever than you imagined. Event to extremely difficult things, humans adapt.
5. Pursuing "Happiness"
  * People's thought process:
    * Have something (time, money, etc)
    * ...In order to do something (travel, write, start a business)
    * ...In order to be something (happy, peaceful, content, or motivated)
