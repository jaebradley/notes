* There are an awfully lot of companies that promote a drinking culture to highlight the fact that their
place of work is fun and doesn't take itself too seriously. The reality is that a drinking culture can be
incredibly effective at excluding a large number of people.

* Pointless statements such as "competitive" and "depends on experience" suggest you're either paying below
market rates or you're looking to lowball potential employees...If you're worried what your existing team will think of the salaries you're advertising then...you just aren't paying them enough.
