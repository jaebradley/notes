# [Procrastination Sucks: So Here's the "Eat That Frog" Way to Powerful Productivity](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/procrastination-sucks-so-heres-the-eat-that-frog-way-to-powerful-productivity-543b07ecf360)

* Throughout my career, I have discovered and rediscovered a simple truth. The ability to concentrate single-mindedly on your most important task, to do it well, and to finish it completely, is the key to great success, achievement, respect, status, and happiness in life.
* Programming requires a lot of mental effort, so no matter how pointless or trivial a task is, it still *feels* productive
* Don't have to be the best in the world - but if you're in the top 10% of some pool - you're doing pretty well
* All self-help and productivity ultimately boils down to the same thing - planning, prioritization, doing hard things, procrastinating on things that don't matter, finishing
* Your ‘frog’ is your biggest, most important task, the one you are most likely to procrastinate on if you don’t do something about it. It is also the one task that can have the greatest positive impact on your life and results at the moment.
* You’re likely to procrastinate because of fear. Fear is a great sign that this thing you have to do is an important frog.
* Write out goals (I'm earning 50% more working at X)
  * Write all requirements
  * Don't forget about obligations - things you have to do anyways
  * Listening things out gives `master` list - every new thing that comes your way should be added to master list
    * Master list doesn't mean it needs to / will be tackled - just so that it's out of head so no need to keep thinking about it
  * Example of goals and requirements
    * Goal: Learning to code
    * Two hours on instructor-driven learnings (courses)
    * An hour learning tools and theory
    * An hour spent building stuff and writing code
* "Learning React" is an admirable accomplishment but if it has nothing to do with goals then time is better spent elsewhere
* One of the very worst uses of time is to do something very well that need not be done at all
* It’s rare to strike gold. So when you do, put more of your time and energy into mining that precious vein, and eliminate everything that doesn’t add to its success.
* ABCDE approach
  * A items - Things you **must** do
  * B items - Things you **should** do
  * C items - Things that are **nice** to do but don't have any real consequences
  * D items - Things to delegate
  * E items - Things to eliminate
* What one skill, if I developed and did it in an excellent fashion, would have the greatest positive impact on my career?
* I just do everything I can to *start* my day with most difficult tasks and get as far along on those as possible
* "Almost Done" probably means "Not Yet Started"
* When you don't finish stuff, when you don't release it out into the public, you'll never reach the top 10% of anything
* Don't start learning Android development because learning JavaScript got too hard
