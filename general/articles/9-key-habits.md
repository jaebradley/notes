[#9 Key Habits That Will Make You Automatically Attract Enormous Success](9 Key Habits That Will Make You Automatically Attract Enormous Success)

* > Most people have an extremely limiting mindset of themselves. Some even wear these limitations as a backwards badge of honor:
  > * Oh, I have no idea how to write a book.”
  > * “I’m awful at all that creative stuff.”
  > * “I can’t start a podcast, I wouldn’t know where to start.”
  > * “I couldn’t start my own business, I’d be a terrible businessman.”
  > This disbelief is negative power.
* > Fail more times than anyone else
  * > When you fail, you learn. When you fail more than anyone else, you learn more than anyone else.
  * > Since their self-worth is tied to their performance, any failure is confirmation that they aren’t good enough. If they suck at something, it means they suck.
* > Behave like a world-class winner — even if you’re not one yet
  * I agree with the general direction of this idea, however, I think the danger is that this behavior can lead to a sense of arrogance that is counterproductive
* > If you’re honest and vulnerable about your struggles and failures, people relate to that.
* > Many people think in terms of ‘I have to do what my colleague/neighbor/family member is doing’ instead of ‘I have to do what’s best for me.
* > Most people are takers.
  * > They take what they can get. Money, opportunities, the last piece of cake — most people would not be quick to selflessly give what could’ve been theirs.
  * > “If you worship money and things, then you will never have enough, never feel you have enough.” - DFW
* > Be more consistent than anyone else
  * > Most people quit before they even get a chance to succeed. They try something for a few weeks, even a few months; but before they reach a place of automatically attracting success, they give up and go home.
