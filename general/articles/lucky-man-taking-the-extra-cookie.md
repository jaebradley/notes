# [Michael Lewis and the Parable of the Lucky Man Taking the Extra Cookie](https://kottke.org/17/06/michael-lewis-and-the-parable-of-the-lucky-man-taking-the-extra-cookie)

* "owe a debt to the unlucky"
* Cal psychology department split students into teams of three to discuss and "solve" some moral problems like discipline for academic cheating or regulating drinking on campus
  * Randomly assigned one student, "leader"
* About 30 minutes in, the students are given a plate of four cookies
* The arbitrarily appointed "leader" of the group almost always ate the leftover cookie, and with gusto
  * "Leader" was not special in any particular way, and was randomly assigned
  * But "leader" still had sense of entitlement
* Those that are privileged may not be entirely lucky, but there is a large element of luck
  * Lucky that they went / were accepted into the college they attended
  * Lucky that they had parents / means to go to the college they attended
  * Lucky that they live in a time / country that has the educational system that they have
  * Lucky that they live in the most prosperous time in human history

> All of you have been faced with the extra cookie.
> All of you will be faced with many more of them.
> In time, you will find it easy to assume that you deserve the extra cookie.
> For all I know, you may.
> But you'll be happier, and the world will be better off, if you at least pretend that you don't.
