* > when I used to be a tailor I had the reputation of being a good one, and making close fits, always punctual with my customers, and always did good work
* Too often we phone it in, cash our check, and dream of some higher station in life. Or we think, *This is just a job, it isn't who I am, it doesn't matter*.
* Only self-absorbed assholes think they are too good for whatever their current station requires
* Wherever we are, whatever we're doing and wherever we are going, we owe it to ourselves, to our art, to the world, to do it well. That's our primary duty. And our obligation. WHen action is our priority, vanity falls away.
* We will be and do many things in our lives. Some are prestigious, some are onerous, none are beneath us. To whatever we face, our job is to respond with hard work, honesty, helping others as best we can
* duty is beautiful, and inspiring, and empowering
