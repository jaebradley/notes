# [Life Is Precious - Don't Waste Yours](https://medium.com/personal-growth/life-is-precious-dont-waste-yours-4344af2e5fbe)

* When I endure a death in my life I funnel even more passion into what I do.
  * I hit the reset button on my comfort zone and wake the hell up from the lie that I’ll be young forever.
* Let your mortality be the cold shower you need to follow your dreams and smash your goals to pieces.
* Go out and shake the world to the tune of your dreams. Don’t hold back any longer and quit living in fear
* There are so many distractions in the modern world and it’s easy for your close friends to forget about you, but your real friends won’t
* Death reminds us how dumb all of these small things are. Why couldn’t you stop fretting the small stuff and focus on what matters?
* Your life has to have meaning. Otherwise, you are going to become horribly sad at some point.
* Your life must mean something otherwise it’s a complete waste.
  * Find out what that meaning is and then go away and take action towards making it a reality.
