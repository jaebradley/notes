# [You're Not Unmotivated, You're Afraid](https://medium.com/personal-growth/youre-not-unmotivated-you-re-afraid-fef4273f339a)

* The real reason we don't get started isn't motivation but that "we’re all very fucking afraid. And the thing with fear is on a surface level it’s indistinguishable from laziness. 90% of the time it’s the former, and 90% of people will assume it’s the latter.”
* Process is
  1. Do scary (but potentially rewarding) shit.
  1. Repeat.
  * There is no step 3. There is no “One Weird Trick.”
* The reason behind our fear is that
  1. We care too much what people think
  2. We care too little about what we want
* Either we’re afraid of people’s opinions directly (admitting failure to our friends, or what they’ll think of our change) or we’re afraid of them indirectly (i.e., we’re afraid of a loss of income, in part, because we’re afraid of losing our social standing.)
* We also often care more about making up things that we think “sound impressive” than we do about actually doing them — very often because we are more delighted by the idea (and how it “sounds”) than the reality.
* If you only focus on “not caring what other people think,” without caring about what you want, you’re going to end up letting their opinions flow back in. We have to actively invest in our interests. Which means we have to know what they are.
* If we’re “afraid,” it’s because we’re not honoring ourselves somewhere.
