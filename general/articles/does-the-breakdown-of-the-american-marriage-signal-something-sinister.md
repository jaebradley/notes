# [Does the Breakdown of the American Marriage Signal Something More Sinister?](https://medium.com/@emmalindsay/does-the-breakdown-of-the-american-marriage-signal-something-more-sinister-baf45584a4d0)

* The interesting part is why did I spend so long giving up things I loved to keep working a job I hated?
  * And, we can say options! or big payout! and that was part of it, for sure.
  * I was hoping for the big payout.
  * But it went deeper than that; I believed my worth was connected with how much I produced. I believed that being an engineer made me valuable in a way that being someone’s girlfriend or being a mother wouldn’t.
* How do we motivate people to do miserable things they don’t want to do?
  * How do we convince people to pour decades of their work into things that are not helping them achieve the goals that would bring them deep happiness?
  * We tell them that they’re better in some non-definable way.
  * We humiliate people who don’t play by the rules, aka, people who don’t earn enough money.
  * Money has become more than just having the means for life; it has become a way of demonstrating your superiority to those around you.
  * This is why people with millions of dollars work their ass off to make millions more; not because they need more things, but because they think twice as much money will make them twice as good.
  * Twice as valuable.
* Then, once they’re “good” enough, it’s presumed that everything will fall into place — marriage, children, etc.
  * Except, it’s a bit of a lie.
  * If you have kids at 45 vs 25, that’s 20 years of time you don’t get to spend with your children.
  * If you kids copy your example, that’s 40 years you don’t get to spend with your grandchildren, which could easily be the difference between ever meeting them or not.
  * This realization hit me a bit earlier than it tends to hit men because, absent invasive technology, I probably can’t have kids at 45.
  * For me, it becomes about even being able to have kids at all.
  * And I know I exist in an extreme area of society, aka the tech sector, but it’s also an area that’s rapidly expanding.
  * It’s an area that has a shit ton of money in a time when people need money, so I expect these forces will intensify over time.
* Somehow, people working 70 hour weeks and sacrificing their happiness and personal life for the goals of their employers believe they are free.
* If I was going to rewrite the slogans for the tech industry, I might come up with this: Slavery is Freedom. Money is Virtue. Suffering is Joy.
* That last one came up because, not only was I expected to put in 70 hour weeks at the office, I was expected to enjoy it.
* If you can’t think of something to do with your vacation, at least take it to sit at home and watch TV.
  * But, most people feel guilty when they do that, so it ruins it for them.
* It’s where the guilt of non-productivity comes from.
  * It’s where the delusion that your value is what you produce, as measured by money comes from.
  * But it’s lies, all lies, that they put inside us so we’ll work for them.
  * It’s lies they put inside us so we won’t find creative solutions that will help us achieve the goals we personally want.
  * We become brainwashed to believe that the goals that our superiors want are the goals we want for ourselves so that we wouldn’t even know how to start if we wanted to improve our personal lives.
* I think most Americans want to get married, and they don’t want their marriages to end in divorce.
  * This trend toward less productive marriages, I believe, is indicative of a cultural shift where people are less able to get what they want in their personal lives because of the demands of their professional lives.
* And, if you think about it, the ideal employee wouldn’t have a personal life.
  * The ideal employee is probably a single, childfree workaholic and *what do you know* that’s exactly the type of person our society is producing more and more of.
  * Ideally, they wouldn’t have too many distracting friends either, hey, check it out — the number of close friends people have is shrinking over time.
  * The decline in marriage is, I believe, both a symptom of this, but also a cause of its acceleration.
