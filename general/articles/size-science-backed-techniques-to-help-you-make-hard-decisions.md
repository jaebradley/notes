* Pro/con - rate things on scale (0.0-1.0) and sum - compare final result against how you feel about outcome (if hesitant, investigate)
* Premortem - address the worst-case scenario, and steps to prevent it
  * Then try to visualize best-case scenario, and gauge feeling - if you're not happy or excited, consider why
  * Amazon asks company developers to draft a hypothetical press release and FAQ at the beginning of the project
  * By working backwards, the team tackles the most difficult decisions upfront and clarifies product value - if a team can't come up with a compelling press release, the product probably isn't worth making
* Avoid binary choices - why choose between this or that?
* Talk to somebody with more experience with a decision
* When you procrastinate or delay and important choice, you're still making a decision - and generally it won't be a good one
