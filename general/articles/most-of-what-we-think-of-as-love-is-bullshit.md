# [Most of What We Think of as Love is Bullshit](https://psiloveyou.xyz/most-of-what-we-think-of-as-love-is-bullshit-5443bb524b92)

* Calling your partner your "everything" is not love
  * Wanting constant reassurance is not love
  * Jealousy is not love
  * Poor boundaries is not love
  * Fear is not love
* Ego and fear cause hurt - love doesn't. When we make somebody hurt, we are not doing it from a position of love.
* Loving response to break up is probably along the lines of "what's wrong" i.e. "what do you want that you're clearly not getting"?
  * Because obviously (at least) one person isn't getting what they want
* > “Whenever someone tells me I’m beautiful, they’re telling me they love themselves.They’re telling me that they want to be around people and things that give them pleasure, and that my physical appearance gives them pleasure. But, they’re not telling me that they care about me.”
* > “Finding someone beautiful is not love, it is self love. Because finding someone extremely pleasurable is not love, it is self love.”
* > “If you spend your life looking for love by trying to find someone who thinks you’re crazy beautiful, you won’t find love. If you spend your life trying to find someone you think is beautiful, you won’t find love.”
* "Because you agree with me on everything!"
  * Didn't say they liked that we agreed with each other on everything, or shared viewpoints, but rather that I was merely a flesh-and-blood mirror in which they saw their favorite things bounced back to them.
* Whatever you are attracted to or think you want or need in a partner is actually what you should first provide for yourself.
* Love is not addition, it's multiplication
  * When you put two half-people together, with both expecting the other to fill in the gaps and “complete” them, you don’t get 1/2 + 1/2 = 1. You get 1/2 x 1/2… 1/4.
  * On the contrary, when you put two healthy, whole people together, with each operating with emotional self-sufficiency, you get 1 x 1… still 1. An entire unit, complete whether in “parts” and as a whole.
* Genuine love requires you to first love and serve yourself and your needs.
* Selfish people are not self-loving. (On the contrary, they are overcompensating for their lack of self-love.)
* We do not win love by frantically scrambling to deny our needs and meet someone else’s — even if we hope that we’ll get ours met if they only do the same back.
* So often we want to mark them as our own, especially with some legal binding to make things more like “forever.”
  * Because God forbid they continue to roam the earth as an individual, with no legal obligation not to stray.
  * God forbid we love them as their own person without a sense of ownership or agency over them.
* What Love is
  * It is deliberate. We have agency in who and how we love, and we are not at the mercy of how the wind blows. Love takes work.
  * Love is not anxious, but secure.
  * Love recognizes that our partner is their own person.
  * Good love is the way in which we love them — it’s us loving their very being, us loving their essence, us loving their ups and downs and imperfections and dumb complaints and irritations and short-comings and differences and decisions — each day.
