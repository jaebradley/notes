## [How Much To Compromise In Relationships](https://medium.com/@krisgage/how-much-to-compromise-in-relationships-b41b3815cdd)

* We know that we're supposed to say NO - we just don't always know WHEN
* Emotional boundaries doesn't just mean "not putting up with their shit" - it also means meeting our own needs, rather than expecting others to
* Emotional boundaries require emotion work, which is different than emotional labor
  * Frustration around emotional labor is a red flag for poor emotional boundaries
* We need to deal with our own emotions before putting them back on others - our feelings are our own responsibliity first
  * Discern which emotions are yours alone to deal with and not project on others
* The problem is we're all so biased and bad knowing boundaries so we can't trust our own judgement
  * So how do we know when we _can_ trust our own judgement? And what if we don't care?
* We're told to "stand up for ourseles" but also to "surrender to love" - we're told to "say no" but never "shut down"
* We're not supposed to sacrifice our dreams for relationships, but most dreams are fantasies anyway

* We almost think something's not worth having unless we killed ourselves to get it
* We tend to deal with insecurity in the worst way - if we don't think we're smart or funny or attractice, we try to convince someone else we are. We want them to think it and say it because we can't.

* I'm no longer looking for promises of forever, what I want is the promise that you'll try your best and you'll be worth it. Promise me that there will be no regrets.
* The best thing you can do for your relationship is to improve yourself because the better you are, the better your relationship can be

## [How Do You Know If They're The One](https://medium.com/@krisgage/how-do-you-know-if-theyre-the-one-c094520516b1)

* It's not about finding - it's about making
* When we view “love” as something that happens “to” us (or something we “fall into”), not only are we setting ourselves up for failure (because we don’t realize that relationships are mostly work, and don’t hinge on feelings not “fading,” because they may), but we also strip ourselves of our own innate agency and power in our lives.
* But relying on “feelings” to get you through a lifelong, mature and healthy relationship is like relying on “motivation” or “inspiration” to do anything else.
* Your father and I, we’re not even 90% right for each other. Not even 60, okay? But he’s the love of my life.
* The thing that should be at the top of your checklist is "emotional stability and self-sufficiency" - and it should be the top thing you cultivate in yourself as well

## [The Most Important Thing In A Relationship](https://medium.com/@krisgage/the-most-important-thing-in-a-relationship-fde6e9087d6f)

* "people who manage their insecurities well" or "the ability to see one's flaws and be accountable for them"
* “We look for happiness from others, but this is an unreliable source of happiness… And here’s the thing: it’s not their job to fill our emotional needs.”
* “If you do not love yourself entirely and actively ensure your own needs are met, you will find it difficult to do the same for others.”
* “If you are bored, fix it. If you are lonely or hurt, comfort yourself. If you are jealous, don’t hope that someone will reassure you … reassure yourself.”

* The real tragedy is the relationship that died months ago, but nobody knows. They just keep trudging through, eating each other up. Zombie relationships do way more damage in the long run. They come to an end eventually, but only after consuming everything you’ve got.

## [5 Toxic Behaviors That Doom Relationships](https://psiloveyou.xyz/5-toxic-behaviors-that-doom-relationships-f232667f620a)

* Relationships end because on person stops. They stop doing acts of service. It's a choice, even when nobody wants to admit it.
* You started telling your dreams to someone else. You started sharing your deepest thoughts and fears. 
* What's bothering you always hatches

* They are willing to let go, if you both have tried as hard as you can to make things work, and things are no longer working. Letting go can be an act of love, because it releases both parties so they can move on, heal and find someone who is a healthier, better match at that point. Emotionally mature, healthy adults let go when a relationship, friendship, or other connection is no longer working.
* They are not just around to hang out when it's convenient. They also bend themselves sometimes in order to make it happen to hang with you too.

* Breakups never end with both people feeling great. But she's a badass and her world is bigger than your relationship. She'll recover.

* In concrete reality, you have to actually like the idea of spending the rest of your life alone. No boyfriend or girlfriend. No dates. No bullshit. If that sounds kinda nice, then you’ve achieved something. Maybe you don’t have to love yourself, or like yourself, but you can get along with yourself just fine.

* Compatibility is about similar lifestyle choices and a shared vision for the life you want to create together. 
* It’s completely different — and equally important, if not more so — than chemistry.
* But when you’re ready to build a life with someone, make sure you both share a similar vision for that life, and that the timing is right for you both - are you both ready to create that vision?
