## [How Much To Compromise In Relationships](https://medium.com/@krisgage/how-much-to-compromise-in-relationships-b41b3815cdd)

* We know that we're supposed to say NO - we just don't always know WHEN
* Emotional boundaries doesn't just mean "not putting up with their shit" - it also means meeting our own needs, rather than expecting others to
* Emotional boundaries require emotion work, which is different than emotional labor
  * Frustration around emotional labor is a red flag for poor emotional boundaries
* We need to deal with our own emotions before putting them back on others - our feelings are our own responsibliity first
  * Discern which emotions are yours alone to deal with and not project on others
* The problem is we're all so biased and bad knowing boundaries so we can't trust our own judgement
  * So how do we know when we _can_ trust our own judgement? And what if we don't care?
* We're told to "stand up for ourseles" but also to "surrender to love" - we're told to "say no" but never "shut down"
* We're not supposed to sacrifice our dreams for relationships, but most dreams are fantasies anyway
