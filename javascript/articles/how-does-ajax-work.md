# How Does AJAX Work?

* [`How Does AJAX Work`](http://lucybain.com/blog/2015/js-how-does-ajax-work/)

* Asynchronous JavaScipt And XML (AJAX)
* After loading page, client can use JavaScript to make HTTP requests to the server and listen for a response asynchronously
* The response that came back could be XML (and probably was, when AJAX was first used) but JSON is the standard now
* AJAX can update the page after it has finished loading
  * Before AJAX, any new content required an entire page refresh
