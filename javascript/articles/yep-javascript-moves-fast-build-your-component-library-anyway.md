# [Yep JavaScript Moves Fast. Build Your Component Library Anyway](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/yep-javascript-moves-fast-build-your-component-library-anyway-a50576ab3031)

* Components eliminate decision fatigue by programmatically enforcing a standardized approach
* These aren't questions your designers and developers should be asking every time they create a new form
* Copy/paste isn't a design pattern
* Using a component a second time requires no additional download and hardly any extra memory
* Without a component library, either there's duplicate JavaScript, or another library is used that will add extra bundle bloat
* More code leads to more maintenance
* It's far easier to migrate a carefully componentized application because you can replace existing components one component at a time
