# Speed of Light and Propagation Latency

* The theoretical round-trip time between NYC and Sydney is 160 milliseconds over a fiber-optic cable
* In practice, it's ~200-300 milliseconds due to the additional routing, processing, queuing, and transmission delays as it hops between cities

# Last-Mile Latency

* Ironically, it is often the last few miles where significant latency is introduced (i.e. the last-mile problem)
* Last mile latencies are ~10-20 ms for fiber, ~15-40 ms for cable, and ~30-65 ms for DSL
