# 8.1.3 Logical versus Physical Address Space

* Address generated by the CPU is commonly referred to as a logical address
* An address loaded into the memory-address register is commonly referred to as a physical address
* Execution-time address-binding result in differing logical (also called, virtual) and physical addresses
* The run-time mapping from virtual to physical addresses is done by a hardware device called the memory-management unit
* Very simple example mapping scheme using the base / relocation register
  *  The value in the relocation register is added to every address generated by a user process at the time the address is sent to memory
  *  Access to location 346 (logical address) is mapped to location 14346 (physical address) in the case where the base register value is 1400
*  The user program never sees the physical address, from the perspective of the user program it thinks that the process runs in the memory address space from 0 to some max value
