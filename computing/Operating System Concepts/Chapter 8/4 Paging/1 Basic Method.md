# 8.4.1 Basic Method

* Break physical memory into fixed-sized blocks called frames
* Break logical memory into blocks of the same size as frames (logical memory blocks are called "pages")
* When a process is loaded into memory, its logical memory pages are loaded into any available physical memory frames
* Every logical address generated by the CPU has a page number and a page offset id
  * The page number an index value into a page table
  * This page table contains the base address of each logical memory page in physical memory (i.e. the beginning of the corresponding physical memory frame)
  * The base address is combined with the page offset id to define the physical memory address that is then used by the memory unit
