# 8.4.1 Basic Method

* Break physical memory into fixed-sized blocks called frames
* Break logical memory into blocks of the same size as frames (logical memory blocks are called "pages")
* When a process is loaded into memory, its logical memory pages are loaded into any available physical memory frames
* Every logical address generated by the CPU has a page number and a page offset id
  * The page number an index value into a page table
  * This page table contains the base address of each logical memory page in physical memory (i.e. the beginning of the corresponding physical memory frame)
  * The base address is combined with the page offset id to define the physical memory address that is then used by the memory unit
* Generally, page sizes are powers of 2
 * If the size of the logical address space (i.e. the page offset id value) is `2^M` and a page contains `2^N` addresses then the high-order `M-N` bits define the page number
* Addresses generated by the CPU look like `|page number (m -n bits)| page offset (n bits)|`

Physical Memory

* Page offset is used here to find physical memory address within the corresponding frame
