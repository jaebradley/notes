# [10.3 Stack Management In a Function](https://bob.cs.sonoma.edu/IntroCompOrg-RPi/sec-stack-manage.html)

* A calling function uses the `b1` instruction to call a function which places the return address in the `lr` register
* The called function needs to preserve this address in order to know where to return to
  * It saves the contents of the `lr` register on the stack
* `push {fp, lr}` instruction pushes the return address (the value contained in the `lr` register) onto the stack
  * Pushes the caller's frame pointer (`fp` register) onto the stack
  * Updates the stack pointer (`sp` register) to show that two 32-bit values have been pushed onto the top of the stack
* The `add` instruction adds `4` to the value in the stack pointer register and stores the sum in the frame pointer register
  * It sets the frame pointer for this function to point to the location on the stack where the frame pointer of the calling function is stored
  * The frame pointer serves a reference point into the stack for this function
  * The area of the stack that this function is allowed to access, is called a stack frame
* The frame pointer is used as a reference point within the area of the stack that the function is allowed to access, called the stack frame
* The `pop {fp, pc}` instruction pops the caller's frame pointer off the top of the stack, back into the frame pointer register
  * Then the return address is popped into the `pc` register and the stack pointer register is updated to the new top of the stack
