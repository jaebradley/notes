# 1.2 Computer Subsystems

* Computer hardware is split into three separate subsystems
  * CPU 
    * controls most of the activities of the computer
    * performs arithmetic and logical operations
    * contains small amount of very fast memory
  * Memory
    * Provides storage for the instructions for the CPU and the data they manipulate
  * Input/Output
    * Communicates with the outside world and with mass storage devices
  * Bus
    * Commpunication pathway with a protocol specifying exactly how the pathway is used
* Creating / running a program
  * Use an editor to write program in some language
  * Editor sees the source code of the written program as data, and is typically stored in a file on disk
  * Then use a compiler program to translate the high-level language statements into machine instructions that are stored in a disk file
  * Compiler program sees both the source code and the resulting machine code as data
  * When executing the program, the instructions are read from the machine code disk file into memory
  * Program is now a sequence of instructions stored in memory
  * CPU executes the program by fetching each instruction from memory and executing it
