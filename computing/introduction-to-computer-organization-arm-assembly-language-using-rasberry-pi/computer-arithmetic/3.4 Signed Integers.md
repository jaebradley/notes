# [3.4 Signed Integers](https://bob.cs.sonoma.edu/IntroCompOrg-RPi/sec-sdints.html)

* Naively using the highest-order bit to represent the sign results in incorrect arithmetic like this
  * `0010 + 1010` which is `(+2 + (-2))` where `0` in the highest-order bit means positive and `1` signifies negative
  * Naively calculating ther result would lead to `1100` which is `-4` in this system (since the highest-order bit of the result is `1`) which is not the same as `0`
  * This way of signing also implies that there is a `+0` and a `-0` (`0000` and `1000`)
* Most computers, including ARM, use two's complement for representing signed decimal integers
* Imagine a casette player with negative  / positive positions on a given casette tape
  * The middle is "zero" and the casette tape uses `4`-digit decimal counter to represent the taope position
  * Moving the tape forward will cause the tape to increment
  * Moving the tape backwards will cause the tape to decrement
  * So moving one unit forward will lead to `+1` on the counter or `0001`
  * Moving one unit backwards will lead to `-1` or `9999`
* Can use this tape analogy to do signed arithmetic
  * In the case of `+2 + (-2)`, move tape two units forwards (counter shows `0002`) and then move tape two units backwards (counter shows `0000`)
  * In the case of `-2 + (+2)`, move tape two units backwards (counter shows `9998`) and then move tape two units forwards (`0000`) with a carry of `1`. If the carry is ignored, the answer is correct
* When adding two signed integers in two's complement code, the carry is irrelevant

## Four Bit Two's Complement Table

| Hex | Bits | Decimal |
|-----|------|---------|
|8    |1000  | -8      |
|9    |1001  | -7      |
|a    |1010  | -6      |
|b    |1011  | -5      |
|c    |1100  | -4      |
|d    |1101  | -3      |
|e    |1110  | -2      |
|f    |1111  | -1      |
|0    |0000  | 0       |
|1    |0001  | +1      |
|2    |0010  | +2      |
|3    |0011  | +3      |
|4    |0100  | +4      |
|5    |0101  | +5      |
|6    |0110  | +6      |
|7    |0111  | +7      |

* Each positive number has a high-order bit of `0` and each negative number has a high-order bit of `1`
* There is one more negative number than positive number
* This also means that for `n` bits, the range of integers that can be represented is `-2^(n-1)` to `2^(n-1) - 1` (inclusive)
* This also implies that the negative of any `n`-bit integer is defined as `x + (-x) = 2^n`
  * `2^n` written in binary is `1` followed by `n` zeroes
  * Adding a number to its negative produces `n` zeroes and a cary
* To calculate the negative of a number in two's complement, solve for the equation `-x = 2^n - x`
  * Note that `x` will have `n` bits but `2^n` will have `n + 1` bits
  * `-123 = 100000000 - 01111011 = 10000101`
    * Subtract `1` from `2^n` in previous calculation to get `11111111`, perform subtraction and then add `1` to the result
  * In other words, take the complement of `x` (flip all the bits) and add `1`
    * The flipping of the bits occurs when `x` is subtracted from `11111111` (or whatever `2^n - 1` results in)
