* Program counter is a special register that always contains the address of the next instruction to be executed
* L1 Cache Memory is very fast memory that is used to store instructions
  * Each instruction must be fetched from memory
  * The CPU can execute instructions much faster than they can be fetched
  * So several instructions are fetched at a time, storing them in the L1 cache, where the CPU has very fast access to them
* Instruction register - contains the instruction that is currently being executed
* Register is a named group of several bytes of memory within the CPU
  * Almost all arithmetic and logic operations and data movement operations involve at least one register
* Condition flags are bits in a status register that show results of many operations performed by the Arithmetic Logic Unit
  * For example, addition can set the Carry Flag to show whether or not a carry was produced
