# [CPU Features](https://bob.cs.sonoma.edu/IntroCompOrg-RPi/sec-int-except.html)

* An exception is an event that causes the CPU to pause the execution of the current code stream and transfer control to a pre-defined location
  * Supervisor calls are program instructions that request a service from the operating system
  * Interrupts occur when I/O devices notify the CPU that the device is ready to transfer data
  * Error conditions are conditions that exist within the CPU that are typically caused by programming errors that cannot be dealt with by the currently running program
* In response to an exception, the following sequence occurs
  * The currently executing instruction completes execution
  * The address of the next instruction is saved
  * The bits in the Current Program Status Register are saved
  * CPU execution is transfered to the code sequence that will handle the cause of the exception
* After the exception has been handled, CPU execution is transferred back to the interrupted code sequence by
  * Restoring the bits in the Current Program Status Register
  * Loading the address of the next instruction in interrupted program
* The operating system uses exception levels in the CPU
* At any given time, the CPU is running in one of the four possible exception levels (higher numbered levels indicate more privileges)
  * `EL0` - Applications
  * `EL1` - OS kernel
  * `EL2` - Virtual machine or hypervisor
  * `EL3` - Secure monitor
* Not all exceptions are due to program errors
  * When a program references an address in another part of the program that has not yet been loaded into memory, it causes a page fault exception
  * The operating system must provide a handler that loads the appropriate part of the program from the disk into memory, then continues with normal program execution
