# [Supervisor Call](https://bob.cs.sonoma.edu/IntroCompOrg-RPi/sec-sup-call.html)

* When the computer is first started, the operating system is at the EL1 exception level
* This level allows the operating system kernel to access all the hardware components of the computing system
* When a user launches an application, the operating system sets up the hardware resources required by the application, changes the CPU to exception level EL0 and transfers CPU control to the application
* An application can use something like the terminal window (which the operating system directly controls / prevents direct access) by using an `svc` instruction
  * This `svc` instruction generates an exception from the software that is running 
  * The instruction `svc 0` will execute supervisor call number `0` (which, I _think_ is "output a character" but I have not found any concrete evidence)
* In the article, one can produce the same behavior with the `write` C system call function and the `write` supervisor call

```assembly
mov   r7, write   @ system call 'write'
svc   0           @ write the message
```

* The `write` C system call function is a wrapper for the `write` supervisor call
