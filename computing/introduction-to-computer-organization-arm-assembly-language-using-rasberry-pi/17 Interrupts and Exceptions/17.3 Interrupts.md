# [Interrupts](https://bob.cs.sonoma.edu/IntroCompOrg-RPi/sec-inters.html)

* If a key is struck in the middle of executing two instructions, the keyboard controller will generate an interrupt request, which will be sent to the CPU
* The CPU needs to be used to read the input from the keyboard
* Then the CPU needs to return to the instruction sequence it was executing when it was interrupted
* The CPU needs to save the current program status register and the return address when an interrupt request is received
* After the CPU saves the current program status register and the return address, the address corresponding to the IRQ vector is loaded into memory to be executed
* The CPU will acknowledge an interrupt request only between instruction execution cycles
* CPU control is transferred to the memory address corresponding to the type of exception in the exception vector table
  * It is the responsibility of the operating system to have placed an appropriate instruction at this memory location
* In the keyboard example, the keyword hardware sends an IRQ to the CPU
  * The CPU responds, executing the instruction at the appropriate memory location
  * This instruction will branch to the code that will read the characters from the keyboard
