# FSB Influence

* Cache content can only be stored and loaded as quickly as the connection to the memory allows
* WHen the FSB is stressed for large working set sizes, testing the same program on two different machines that only differ in the speed of their memory modules see a performance difference
  * A 20% increase in the speed of the processor showed a 18.2% maximum performance increase
  * It is not critical when the working set fits into the caches
* The working set of a system comprises the memory needed by all concurrently running processes
* If speed is important, and working sets are larger, fast RAM and high FSB speeds are necessary
