# [Recipients](https://explained-from-first-principles.com/email/#common-addresses)

* `Cc` stands for `carbon copy`
* `Bcc` (`blind carbon copy`) contains the addresses of hidden recipients
  * Addresses are not revealed to other recipients of the message
  * Field is usually fully preserved in your folder of sent messages but fully removed in the version of the email that is delivered to others
  * Standard also allows hidden recipients to see each other, they just have to be removed for the primary and secondary recipients
* Just because someone is listed as another recipient does not mean that they have received the same message as you
