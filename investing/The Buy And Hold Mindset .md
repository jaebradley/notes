# [The Buy And Hold Mindset](https://avc.com/2022/11/the-buy-and-hold-mindset/)

* Author targets ~5-10% annual return on investment in real-estate space
  * Converts to PE between 10-20x earnings
* VC firms project at least 10x returns on a successful exit, unless there's amature company with better line of sight to an exit - then 5x
* Google is trading at 6.4% cap rate / PE of 18x
* If you think Google / Company X is going to be around for the next 20 years, and that the business will be stable / growing, then the current prices resemble what a real estate owner might pay for them if they were buildings
  * 6.4% annual return compounded over 10 years is about double
* If you are investing for a very long time horizon, prices right now may be reasonable
