# Definitions

* `root` - node with no parents
  * At most one per tree
* `leaf` - node with no children (end of tree)
* `sibling` - nodes that are children of the same parent
* `depth` - the length of the path from the root to the node
* `level` - nodes at a given depth in a tree
* `height` - length of path from that node to deepest node
* Binary Tree - each node has 0, 1, or 2 children
* Strict Binary Tree - each node has 2 children or 0 children
* Full Binary Tree - each node has exactly 2 children and all leaf nodes are at the same level
* Complete Binary Tree is a binary tree in which every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes are as far left as possible
