# [Negative Space: The 2-Hour Rule That Changed My Life](https://medium.com/the-realist/negative-space-the-2-hour-rule-that-changed-my-life-d4d0f93967c7)

* Crowded schedules = diminishing ability to focus, think deeply, make thoughtful decisions
* In visual art, negative space refers to empty areas around and between subjects of an image
  * The blank canvas that allows the eye to focus on the main elements of the composition
* Schedule unstructured time (no social media, email, tasks) to be this "negative" space
* "Creative people need time to sit around and do nothing"
  * Allows mind freedom to make connections, generate new ideas, etc
  * Used to have ideas again instead of "grinding through tasks"
* Can read a book, sketch randomly, drink coffee - important not to be trying to "do something productive"
* May feel physically uncomfortable / guilty that the time is not being used "wisely"
* Start small and block a couple hours
* Turn off phone notifications
* Do absolutely nothing if you that's what makes sense
* Don't try to "optimize" the time
* Don't check email
* Don't use the time for errands for life admin
* Don't work later because this time was used
