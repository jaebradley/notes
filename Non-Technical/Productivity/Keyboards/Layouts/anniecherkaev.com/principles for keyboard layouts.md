# [principles for keyboard layouts](https://anniecherkaev.com/principles-for-keyboard-layouts)

* Nearly constant usage of thumbs is a sign that the most commonly typed keys are correctly placed in the thumb clusters
* hands should stay fairly steady on the home row
* Author has the first non-default layer (Layer 1) contain special characters like `~`, `@`, `[`, etc
* Author has default layer have `Copy` and `Paste` for macOS
* Default layer has two buttons to navigate to the different layers
* Layer 2 is the audio control layer, play, pause, previous, next, mute, volume down, volume up

## Principles

* Only use keys that can be reached from the homerow
* One of the big thumb buttons creates a new todo item in the authorâ€™s todo list app of choice

## Assigning the special-character-layer thumb cluster

* Author made a list of how often certain special characters were typed
* Was period, comma, apostrophe, double-quote, pound, etc.
* Grouped conceptually similar keys, like brackets
