# [How to Do Great Work](http://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html)

* Work needs to have three qualities
  * Natural aptitude
  * Deep interest
  * Scope to do great work
* Develop a habit of working on your own projects
* Excited curiosity is both the engine and rudder of great work
  * Drives you and shows you what to work on
* What are you curious about to a degree that would bore most other people
* Knowledge expands fractally
  * From a distance, the edges look smooth
  * Once you learn enough to get close to the edges, they are full of gaps
  * Brain wants to ignore gaps to develop a simpler model of the world

## Motivation
* It's ok to lie to yourself about how much work a project will entail
* Finishing things is not just an exercise in tidiness or self-discipline
 * Best work happens in what was meant to be the final stage

## Procrastination

* Project procrastination is dangerous
* Put off starting an ambitious project because the time isn't quite right
* Can camoflage itself as work since you're working on something else
* Am I working on what I most want to work on?

## Growth

* Compounding work grows exponentially
* Learning is a form of compounding work (the more you learn, the easier it is to learn more)
* Exponential growth curve feels flat at beginning
* People push through initial, unrewarding phase of learning something new
 * Know from experience that learning new things always takes an initial push

## Aiming High

* Until you know what is the best and _what makes it so_, you don't know what you're aiming for
* If you don't try to be the best, you won't even be good
 * Ambition to be the best is a qualitatively different thing from ambition to be good
 * "Being good" is too vague of a standard
* Shooting for "being the best" simplifies things as the target is easier to measure against than "merely trying to be good"
* Target making things that people will care about in one hundred years - something that still seems good in a hundred years is more likely to be genuinely good

## Intellectual Honesty

* Being earnest means avoiding affectation and similar vices
* The core of being earnest is being intellectually honest
* One way to avoid intellectual dishonesty is to maintain a slight positive pressure in the opposite direction
* Be aggressively willing to admit you're mistaken
* One reason nerds have an advantage in doing great work - they expend little effort on seeming anything
 * Formality / affectation / looking a certain way has a cost associated with it

## Consistency and Elegance

* When facing a decision, ask which choice is more consistent
* Have to be willing to throw things away and redo them
* Laborious solutions will often have more prestige in the short-term
 * Cost a lot of effort and they're hard to understand, which can impress people (temporarily)

## Originality

* Original ideas come from trying to build or undersatnd something slightly too difficult
* Talking or writing about interest is a good way to generate new ideas
* Distribute attention across topics unequally (power law)
 * Professionally curious about a few topics and idly curious about many more

## Rule Breaking

* One way to discover broken models is to be stricter than other people
* To find new ideas you have to seize on signs of breakage
 * Broken models leave a trail of clues where they bash against reality
* Paradoxically, have to be willing to break rules
* New ideas seem much more conservative once they succeed
* A good new idea has to seem bad to most people, or someone would have already exported it
* Other way to break rules is to not care about them or not know they exist
 * Novices and outsiders' ignorance of a field's assumptions often help them make new discoveries

## Idea Identification

* Ask what would be a good idea for someone else to explore
* What principles are people in your field too attached to? What becomes possible if you discard it?
