# [How to Do Great Work](http://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html)

* Work needs to have three qualities
  * Natural aptitude
  * Deep interest
  * Scope to do great work
* Develop a habit of working on your own projects
* Excited curiosity is both the engine and rudder of great work
  * Drives you and shows you what to work on
* What are you curious about to a degree that would bore most other people
* Knowledge expands fractally
  * From a distance, the edges look smooth
  * Once you learn enough to get close to the edges, they are full of gaps
  * Brain wants to ignore gaps to develop a simpler model of the world
