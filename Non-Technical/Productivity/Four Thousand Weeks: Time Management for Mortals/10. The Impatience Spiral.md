# 10. The Impatience Spiral

* Working too hastily means you'll make more errors, which you'll be obliged to go back to correct, all but guaranteeing to make the process last much longer

## Escape Velocity

* Since the beginning of the modern era of acceleration, people have been responding not with satisfaction at all the time saved, but with increasing agitation that they can't make things move faster
* When people complain that they no longer have time, what they mean is that when they do find time to read or do task X, they are too impatient to give themselves over to the task

## Must Stop, Can't Stop

* "As soon as I slow down, the feeling of anxiety wells up inside, and I look for something to take it away" - the smartphone, the to-do list - tools of "high-speed" living that serve as a form of emotional avoidance
* As the world gets faster and faster, we believe that our happiness, financial survival, depends on being able to work, move, and make things happen at superhuman speed
* Become anxious about not being able to keep up
  * To quell the anxiety, to try and achieve the feeling that our lives are under control, we move faster
  * This creates a spiral - pushing ourselves harder inorder to relieve ourselves of this anxiety results in even more anxiety
  * The faster we go, the clearer it becomes that we'll never succeed in getting ourselves or the rest of the world to move as fast as we feel is necessary
* Must surrender to the reality that things just take the time they take
* Can't quiet your anxieties by working faster, because it isn't within your power to force reality's pace
* Giving a difficult novel the time it demands becomes a source of relish - you cultivate an appreciation for endurance. You give up on demanding instant resolution, instant relief from discomfort, pain,  magical fixes
