# 7. We Never Really Have Time

* Hofstadter's law: any task you're planning to tackle will always take longer than you expect, even when you take into account Hofstadter's law
* A surprisingly effective antidote to anxiety can be to simply realize that the demand for reassurances from the future is one that will definitely never be satisfied
* A life spent "not minding what happens" is one lived without the inner demand to know that the future will conform to your desires for it
* No need to be constantly on edge, waiting to discover if things will unfold as expected
* Does _not_ imply that we can't / shouldn't act wisely in the present to reduce the chances of bad developments
* We can stop demanding certainty that things will go our way later on, leading to liberation from anxiety in the only moment that ever actually exists, which is this moment
