# 12. The Loneliness of the Digital Nomad

* Time is a netwook good
  * Part of its value is from how many other people have access it to it and how well their time coordinates with your time

## In and Out of Sync

* Digital nomad's "freedom" to do whatever he wanted, whenever he chose, meant that ordinary pleasures to do things with other people were now a challenge
* Study of Swedish workforce that demonstrated that even retired people, despite not having jobs from which to take breaks, were happier when more of the Swedish workforce was on holiday
* Part of what makes weekends fun is spending time with others who are also off work
* Sweden has the concept of _fika_ - the daily moment when everyone in a workplace to gather for coffee and cake
* Soviet government tried to make workers more efficient by making "weeks" four days of work, followed by one day of rest
  * Crucially, not all workers would follow the same calendar
  * Workers were divided into five groups
  * These workers would have different weekends so that operations wouldn't cease
  * This experiment ended up destroying social lives due to the non-overlapping schedules
* The value of time doesn't just come from the sheer quantity of time you have, but whether your time is in sync with the people you care about most

## Keeping Together in Time

* Synchronized movement has been a vastly underappreciated force in world history
  * Fostering cohesion amongst diverse groups
* Roman generals first discovered that soldiers marching in synchrony could be made to travel for far longer distances before succumbing to fatigue
