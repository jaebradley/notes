# 4. Becoming a Better Procrastinator

* Goal isn't to eradicate procrastination - instead, choose more wisely what you're going to procrastinate on, in order to focus on what matters most
* The real measure of any time management technique is whether or not it helps you neglect the right thing
* If a certain activity really matters to you, the only way to be sure it will happen is to some of it today, no matter how little, no matter how many other genuinely big rocks are begging for your attention
* Limit the work in progress
* Most appealing way to resist the truth about your finite time is to initiate a large number of projects at once - feels as if you're making progress on all fronts
  * Progress on no fronts - each time a project starts to feel difficult/frightening/boring you can bounce to a different one instead
* No more than three items at any given time
  * Point is not to force yourself to finish everything you start
  * Eliminate bad habit of an ever-proliferating number of half-finished projects on the back burner
* Resist middling priorities
  * Of your top 25 things to do, focus on the top 5 things and eliminate the remaining 20
  * Avoid the remaining 20 at all costs
  * Ambitions insufficiently important to form the core of his life but seductive enough to distract him from the ambitions that matter most
* It's the moderately appealing options (the "fairly" interesting job opportunity, the semi-enjoyable friendship) on which a finite life can come to grief
* You need to learn how to start saying no to things you do want to do, recognizing that you only have one life
