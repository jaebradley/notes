# 4. Becoming a Better Procrastinator

* Goal isn't to eradicate procrastination - instead, choose more wisely what you're going to procrastinate on, in order to focus on what matters most
* The real measure of any time management technique is whether or not it helps you neglect the right thing
* If a certain activity really matters to you, the only way to be sure it will happen is to some of it today, no matter how little, no matter how many other genuinely big rocks are begging for your attention
* Limit the work in progress
* Most appealing way to resist the truth about your finite time is to initiate a large number of projects at once - feels as if you're making progress on all fronts
  * Progress on no fronts - each time a project starts to feel difficult/frightening/boring you can bounce to a different one instead
* No more than three items at any given time
  * Point is not to force yourself to finish everything you start
  * Eliminate bad habit of an ever-proliferating number of half-finished projects on the back burner
* Resist middling priorities
  * Of your top 25 things to do, focus on the top 5 things and eliminate the remaining 20
  * Avoid the remaining 20 at all costs
  * Ambitions insufficiently important to form the core of his life but seductive enough to distract him from the ambitions that matter most
* It's the moderately appealing options (the "fairly" interesting job opportunity, the semi-enjoyable friendship) on which a finite life can come to grief
* You need to learn how to start saying no to things you do want to do, recognizing that you only have one life
* Story of how perfectionist architect tasked with building mosque burned his "perfect" designs as the best builders would be unable to reproduce his plans perfectly
  * He thought it better to cherish an ideal fantasy than to resign himself to reality with its limitations and unpredictability
* Any attempt to bring our ideas into concrete reality must inevitably fall short of our dreams, no matter how brilliatnly we succeed in carrying things off
  * In other words, if you're procrastinating on something because you're worried you won't do a good enough job, you can relax because judged by the flawless standards of your imagination, you definitely won't do a good enough job. And that's ok - so you might as well make a start

## Relationships and settling

* Since time is finite, the decision to refuse to settle - and spend potentially all your life finding the perfect person - is in a way, a case of settling, as this decision is a different sort of suboptimal solution
* Striving" (i.e. living life to the fullest) can't happen without first settling
  * You can't have an ultrasuccessful career without first "settling" on that career (at the expense of all other careers)
* Similarly, exploring a romantic relationship requires settling for that relationship, imperfections and all, and spurning the allure of an infinite number of theoretical alternatives
* It's common to enter a relationship hoping that a partner will provide an unlimited sense of stability and an unlimited sense of excitement
  * The reality is that these demands are contradictory
* Experiment where participants were given art
  * First group could return art in a month
  * Second group was told they could not return their art - decision was permanent
  * Those who were stuck with their decision, who weren't distracted by the thought that it might be possible to make abetter choice showed more appreciation for the art they selected
