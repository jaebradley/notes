# 6. The Intimate Interrupter

* Author talks about a monk in-training that had a training regiment that included taking ice-cold baths
  * Concentrating on the sensations of intense cold made them less agonizing
  * When his attention wandered that's when the suffering became unbearable
  * Focusing on the experience of whatever he was doing, he realized that the real problem was not the activity but his internal resistance to experiencing it
* What we think of as "distractions" aren't the ultimate cause of being distracted - they are just the places we go to seek relief from the discomfort of confronting limitation
  * "Checking your phone" is what you do _because_ it's hard to focus on the conversation
* Some Buddhists believe that the entirety of human suffering can be boiled down to the effort to resist paying full attention to the way things are going because we wish they were going differently
