* Tourists at the British Museum were so focused on recording images on their phones, that they were barely experiencing the exhibition itself
* The "when-I-finally" mindset occurs when a person believes they don't feel fulfilled and happy because they haven't accomplished certain specific things
  * This person believes once they do accomplish certain specific things that they'll feel in charge of their life and a master of their time
  * In fact, this person is trying to achieve a sense of security that they'll never fulfill as they are treating the present solely as a path to some superior future state
  * Thus, the present moment will never feel satisfying in itself
* The effort to solely "live in the present" though seemingly opposite the isntrumentalist future-focused mindset that has been critized, is actually a slightly different version of that same outlook
  * Being fixated on trying to make the best use of your time by focusing on what's happening right now (vs. what's happening in the future) obscures the experience itself
  * Like trying too hard to fall asleep
