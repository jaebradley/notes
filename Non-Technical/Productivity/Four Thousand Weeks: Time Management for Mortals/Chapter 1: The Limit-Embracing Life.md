# Chapter 1: The Limit-Embracing Life

* In days before clocks, when explaining how long something took, had to compare it against some concrete activity
  * Medieval people compared tasks to "Miserere whyle" - the approximate time it took to recite Psalm 50 (Miserere), from the Bible
* Deep time is when we don't hear the clock ticking (even though it, of course, does not stop)
* It's easy to assume that the only answer must be to make better use of time, to become more efficient
  * Instead, it might be better to ask whether the demands themselves might be unreasonable
* "Deep time" is the sense of timeless time, which depends on forgetting the abstract yardstick and plunging back into the vividness of reality instead
* The more you believe you might succeed in "fitting everything in", the more commitments you naturally take on
  * The less you feel the need to ask whether or not each new commitment is truly worth a portion of your time
  * This leads to days that fill up with activities that you inevitably do not value
* The more you hurry, the more frustrating it will be to encounter tasks that cannot be hurried
  * The more compulsively you will plan for the future
  * The more anxious you feel about any remaining uncertainties, of which, there will of course, be plenty
* **Paradox of Limitation:** the more you try to manage your time with the goal of achieving a feeling of total control, and freedom from the inevitable constraints of being human, the more stressful, empty, and frustrating life gets
* Every decision to use a portion of time on anything represents the sacrifice of all the other ways in which you could have spent that time, but didn't
  * To amke that sacrifice is to take a stand on what matters most to you
* Meaningful productivity comes from not hurrying things, but from letting them take the time they take, surrendering to what Germans call Eigenzeit - the time inherent to a process itself
