# 3. Facing Finitude

* "What would my dead colleague to have given to be caught in this traffic jam"
* Focus was no longer exclusively on what he was doing or what he'd rather be doing - noticed that he was doing those things, and there was an increase in gratitude of being alive
* Each decision is an opportunity to select from an enticing set of possibilities, when you might have never been presented with the menu to begin with
* Picking an item from this menu, far from representing some kind of defeat, becomes an affirmation
  * It's a positive commitment to spend a portion of time doing this instead of that - instead of an infinite number of "thats"
* It's precisely the fact that getting married forecloses the possibility of meeting someone else that makes marriage meaningful
  * The joy of missing out vs. the fear of missing out
* Being able to do everything means, in some way, that your choices wouldn't truly mean anything
