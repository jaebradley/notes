# 9. Rediscovering Rest

* It begins to feel as though you're failing at life, in some indistinct way, if you're not treating your time off as an investment in your future
* Leisure no longer feels very leisurely
* Spending at least some of your leisure time "wastefully" focused solely on the pleasure of the experience is the only way _not_ to waste it - to truly be at leisure vs. "covertly" engaged in future-focused self-improvement
* Have to refrain from using every spare hour for personal growth
* Idleness isn't merely forgivable - it's practically an obligation

## Pathological Productivity

* Example of incredibly "productive" person who conceded to use productivity as a way to avoid confronting difficult emotions
* In a way, this individual was unable to refrain from using time productively
* Weber's theory of capitalism: people spend their days generating vast amounts of wealth through hard work + wame people do not feel obligated to fritter it away to luxuries = large accumulations of capital
* As long as you're filling every hour of the day with some form of striving, you can believe that all the striving is leading you somewhere - some imagined future state of perfection
  * Free of the fuilty sense that there's more you need to be doing in order to justify your existence

## Rules for Rest

* The first important thing we can do in order to experience genuine rest is to simply stop expecting it to feel good (at least initially)
  * Nothing is more alien to the present age than idleness
  * How can there be play in a time when nothing has meaning unless it leads to something else

## Hiking as an End in Itself

* You shouldn't be aiming to get a walk "done" nor are you likely to reach a point in your life when you've accomplished all the walking you were aiming to do
* So the only reason to do anything is for those things alone
  * There is no more to going for a walk than what you are doing right now

## Rod Stewart, Radical

* Some things are worth doing for themselves alone, despite offering no payoffs in terms of productivity or profit
* In order to be a source of true fulfillment, a good hobby probably should feel a little embarassing - a sign you're doing it for its own sake vs. some socially sanctioned outcome
