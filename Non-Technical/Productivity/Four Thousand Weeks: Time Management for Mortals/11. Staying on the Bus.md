# 11. Staying on the Bus

* Some art forms impose a temporal constraint on their audiences (like a film screening or a musical concert)
  * Not much choice but to let the work take its time
* Some other art would benefit from setting external restraints (like paintings)
  * Easy to look at a painting for a couple of seconds and think you've genuinely seen it
* While setting aside dedicated time to observe a painting, a second-order change occurs
  * Abandoning efforts to dictate the speed at which an experience progresses leads to the beginning of the "real" experience
