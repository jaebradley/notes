# 11. Staying on the Bus

* Some art forms impose a temporal constraint on their audiences (like a film screening or a musical concert)
  * Not much choice but to let the work take its time
* Some other art would benefit from setting external restraints (like paintings)
  * Easy to look at a painting for a couple of seconds and think you've genuinely seen it
* While setting aside dedicated time to observe a painting, a second-order change occurs
  * Abandoning efforts to dictate the speed at which an experience progresses leads to the beginning of the "real" experience

## Watching and Waiting

* Uneasy experiencing reality unfolding at its own speed
* So we race towards a resolution - any resolution - so we can tell ourselves that we are in control of the situation

## Three Principles of Patience

* Two problems whenever a problem occurs - the specific problem at hand, and because we believe (could be subconscious) that we shouldn't have any problems at all
* Literature students' impatient desire to hasten their work beyond its "appropriate" pace, to race on to the point of completion, that actually impeded progress
* Students couldn't stand the discomfort from being forced to acknowledge limited control over the speed of the creative process
  * Sought to escape it by not working, or rushing headlong into stressful all-day writing binges
  * Binges led to procrastination, making them hate the whole endeavor
* Radical incrementalist - stop when your daily time is up, even if you're bursting with energy and feel as though you could get even more done
* The urge to push onward beyond the agreed-upon point includes a big component of impatience about not being finished, about not being productive enough, about never finding an ideal team for work
* Stopping helps strengthen the muscle of patience that will permit you to return to the project again (and again), sustaining productivity for a career
