# 2. The Efficiency Trap

* The problem with trying to make time for everything that feels important is that you definitely never will
* There's no reason to believe you'll ever feel on top of things or make time for everything that matters, simply by getting more done
* If you succeed in fitting more in, you'll find the goalposts start to shift and more things will be important, meaningful, obligatory
* When housewives first got access to labor-saving devices like washing machines and vacuum cleaners, time wasn't saved because society's standards of cleanliness simply rose to offset the benefit
* Because replying to an email increases the chances of a reply, and because you'll become known as somebody that responds promptly to email, more people will consider it worth their while to message you
  * In other words, "getting through your email" actually generates more emails - this is the "efficiency trap"
* Negligent emailers frequently find that forgetting to reply ends up saving them time - people find alternatives to the problems they were nagging you to solve
* The efficiency trap is that rendering yourself more efficient (productivity techniques, working harder) won't generate the feeling of having enough time, because the demands will increase to offset any benefits
  * You'll be getting "things done" but you'll also be creating additional new things to do
* The more firmly you believe it ought to be possible find time for everything, the less pressure you'll feel to ask whether any given activity is the best use for a portion of your time
* If you never stop to ask yourself if the sacrifice is worth it, your days will automatically begin to fill not just with more things, but with more trivial or tedious things, because they've never had to clear the hurdle of being judged more important than something else
* The things that get done dilligently are the unimportant tasks
* Important tasks need full focus - meaning that one has to wait until there is a large chunk of free time and no small-but-urgent tasks that need attention
  * So then all the energy and time is spent finishing these small tasks only to discover that the entire day was spent with these small tasks and no time was set aside for the important tasks
  * One can waste years systematically postponing precisely the things one cares about the most
* Once you truly understand you're guaranteed to miss out on almost every experience the world has to offer, the fact that there are so many you still haven't experienced stops feeling like a problem
* Convenience services that will send a birthday card on your behalf - both sender and recipient know that this service is a poor substitute for the whole process of sending a birthday card yourself
  * This is because, it isn't the thought that counts but the effort - the inconvenience
  * When the process becomes more convenient, you drain it of its meaning
* Pitfalls of convenience culture - "I prefer to brew my own coffee...but instant coffee is so convenient I hardly do what I prefer"
