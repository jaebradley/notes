# 1. The Limit-Embracing Life

* In medieval times, people compared the time a task took with the length it would take to recite passages from the Bible (like Psalm 50, known as Miserere)
* Deep time are moments when we slip into a realm where we are not trying to fill a void in ourselves or the world
  * The clock does not stop, but we do not hear it ticking
* When faced with too many demands it's easy to assume that the only answer is to make better use of time, by becoming more efficient instead of asking whether the demands themselves might be unreasonable
* Deep time is the sense of timeless time, forgetting the abstract yardstick and plunging back into the vividness of reality instead
* The more you believe you might succeed in fitting everything in, the more commitments you naturally take on, and the less you feel the need to ask whether each new commitment is truly worth a portion of your time, the more your day fills with activities you don't especially value
* The more you hurry, the more frustrating tasks that won't be hurried, and thus you'll increasingly compulsively plan for the future, feeling more and more anxious about any remaining uncertainties (of which there will be plenty)
* The more you try to manage your time with the goal of achieving a feeling of total control and freedom from the inevitable constraints of being human, the more stressful, empty and frustrating life gets
* Every decision to use a portion of time on anything represents the sacrifice of all the other ways in which you could have spent that time but didn't
  * And to willingly make that sacrifice is to take a stand, without reservation, on what matters most to you
* Meaning productivity comes not from nurrying things up, but from letting them take the time they take
