* Anti-libraries are the books we buy but never read
* Author's set of anti-\* concepts
  * Domains that the author bought for big projects but never executed on
  * Similar to the domains: websites that the author was going to make, but never shipped
  * Anti-layers: the designs that were crafted but never built
  * Anti-code: Changes that were usable and shippable but never made it to production
  * Anti-posts (i.e. drafts)
