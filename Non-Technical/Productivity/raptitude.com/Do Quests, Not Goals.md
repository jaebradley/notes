# [Do Quests, Not Goals](https://www.raptitude.com/2024/08/do-quests-not-goals/)

* Goals are things you expect to do later, because they are’t strictly necessary, and you’re busy with the to-do stuff
* You need to do goal-like things, and do them on your own initiative
* Form your own aspirations, and work towards them systematically
* Efforts have to happen now, and not in some hypotetical later-state - they must happen alongside a regular, busy, workday, or they won’t happen
* Tendency to wait for a “better”, less cluttered stretch of time to appear
* However, this is backwards - forming and achieving aspirations is how life gets easier and more spacious
* Building skills, gaining experience, inveting things, decluttering home, starting business

## Quest Mentality

* Usually called a “short-term goal” but “quest” has a different “buzz” to it
* A “quest” is an adventure, to new and unfamiliar landscapes, and the mental model is something that is fun and curious vs. the goal-based model that is framed around “setbacks”, “problems”, etc
* Quests are personally transformative, the endeavor itself shapes you and what you’re capable of
* Quests have dragons to slay, that seem unconquerable at a distance, yet the hero has a way (usually by overcoming some inner limitation that the hero thought was a permanent flaw)
* The quest mentaility sees the dragon as a motivator  (whereas with a goal-based mentality, the dragon is seen as a bad thing)
* Dragon doesn’t want to fight you, it just wants to “frighten” you into not starting
