# [Good and Bad Procrastination](http://www.paulgraham.com/procrastination.html)

* Three types of procrastination (do nothing, something less important, something more important)
  * Last type is "good procrastination" (absent-minded professor forgetting to shave)
  * Good procrastination is avoiding errands to do real work (though will probably annoy people that want you to do the errands)
* Real work needs two things that errands don't - big chunks of time and the right mood
* Startups may be more productive at the beginning, because there's no one to interrupt them
  * It may be better to be overworked than interrupted
  * Once you dilute a startup with ordinary office workers (type 2 procrastinators) the whole company starts resonating at their frequency
* Errands are so effective at killing great projects that a lot of people use them for that purpose
  * Somebody writing a novel finds that the house needs cleaning
* The most dangerous type of procrastination is unacknowledged type 2 procrastination because it doesn't feel like procrastination (you're "getting things done" but they are the wrong things)
* Nearly everyone's to-do list is a form of type 2 procrastination
* Richard Hamming's 3 questions - what are the most important problems in your field, are you working on one of them, why not
  * What's the best thing you could be working on and why aren't you?
* The bigger the problem, the harder it is to get yourself to work on it
  * If the reward is indefinitely far in the future, it seems less real
  * Fear of wasting time - all the time they've spent on it will be wasted
* Don't look a big problem too directly in the eye
  * Approach it where you catch some of the excitement radiating from it, but not enough that it will paralyze you
* Trick yourself to work on big things
  * Work on small things that could grow into big things
  * Or work on successively larger things
* The "solution" to procrastination is to let delight pull you instead of making a to-do list push you
