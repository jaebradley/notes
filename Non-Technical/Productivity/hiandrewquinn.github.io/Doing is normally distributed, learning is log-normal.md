# [Doing is normally distributed, learning is log-normal](https://hiandrewquinn.github.io/til-site/posts/doing-is-normally-distributed-learning-is-log-normal/)

* All traditional project management estimation is loosely based around the idea that each individual step in the project execution chain is bell-shaped
* A process taking twice as long as it normally does might be 2 standard deviations out, in the bottom 2.5% of outcomes
* In a log-normal distribution, processes taking two, three, or five times as long are much more common
* Business processes that are normally-distributed are the exception, not the norm
* Every new process a person has to undertake will have at least some phase which is dominated by learning
* Special kind of rigor to transform process into a repeatable activity routine that generates the long tail of normally-distributed profitable activity
* Academic learning is less log-normal because the actual things you need to learn are carefully plotted ahead of time - online tutorials tamp down on the worst-case scenario
