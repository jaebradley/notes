# [Improving your life with checklists](https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/sysadmin/UseAChecklist)
* Author wrote down all the things the author needed to do
* No vague handwaves or high level overviews - wrote down precise details
* This made sure that the author understand exactly what they'd need to do when the time came
* Didn't use the checklist as a frozen task that had to be fully complete before the author did anything
* Reordered items on the fly
  * Added items, changed items
* Checklist unveiled what could be done in advance, and what could be done in parallel
