## Easier Is Often Better

* Just because something is difficult does not mean the reward for doing it is automatically better
* Fine line between taking on a worthwhile challenge and taking on unnecessary stress

## Gorman Decision Matrix

* The "risk" of a decision is the product of the expected outcome and the importance of the outcome
* Instead of "risk" vs. "reward" the most important variables are the likelihood of certain outcomes and the stakes of those outcomes

```
|         | High | Med | Low |
| Success |      |     |     |
| Unknown |      |     |     |
| Failure |      |     |     |
```

* "Stakes" = how much a given course of action matters
* Likely Success / High Stakes = "North Stars" / must-haves
* Unknown Outcome / High Stakes = "Moonshots"
* Likely Failure / High Stakes = "Waterloo" / sunk costs and time sinks
* Likely Success / Medium Stakes = "Your wheelhouse"
* Unknown Outcome / Medium Stakes = "Growth Opportunities"
* Likely Failure / Medium Stakes = "Demoralizers"
  * Examples: appllying for jobs you want, but aren't qualified for, getting rejected by somebody, burning turkey on Thanksgiving
  * You're in over your skis and it can feel like the end of the world, but it isn't
* Likely Success / Low Stakes = "Layups" / "big fish, small pond"
* Unknown Outcome / Low Stakes = "First time trying anything that can't kill or embarass you"
* Likely Failure / Low Stakes = "Fool's errand"

## Common Time Management Errors

* Procrastination occurs because we doubt our capabilities and yearn to distract ourselves with lower-stakes actions where we expect a more certain outcome
* Think about challenges and obstacles as context and problems to solve, instead of flaws
* The opposite of distraction is not "focus" - it's "traction"
  * Traction pulls us toward what we want to do and who we want to become

## Procrastination

* Pushes decision-making to right (or towards lower stakes) of our decision matrix as these decisions are less emotionally daunting
* Also means much more likely to move towards the top and bottom of the matrix, as we want reassurances of outcomes

## Overextension

* Less of a self-doubt problem and more of a self-worth issue
* We take on too much because we feel compelled to do so, due to insecurities or hubris
* Pushes decision-making to the left of the decision matrix because we're trying to prove ourselves
* "Riskier" decisions will feel better as "guaranteed" successes will feel less meaningful while failures are avoided at all costs

## Optimal Decision, Charted

* Start by moving from the lower right and move up the column _before_ venturing to the column on the left
* Mastery is moving up the column (i.e. improving odds of success)
* Leveling up is moving over a column
* Balance between spending too much time in a column vs. moving over a column too quickly
* Middle row is about risk-taking
* Self-doubt means you desire the outcome, and there will be growth
* Annoyance, meaningless, misery, frustration means walk away (if you can)
  * Side-effects of a futile effort, or where the juice isn't worth the squeeze
