# Chapter 7: Express-Show Your Work

* A flaw in focusing on the final results is that all the intermediate work, the notes, the drafts, the outline, tends to be underappreciated and undervalued

## Intermediate Packets

* It's not enough to simply divide tasks into smaller pieces - you need a system for managing those pieces
* Without this system, just creating a lot of extra work tracking these smaller tasks
* Distilled notes, outtakes (material or ideas that didn't make it into a past project but could make a future one), work in-process (material used / produced in past projects), final deliverables are the main kinds of Intermediate Packets
  * Writing an essay and decide to cut a paragraph - can save the paragraph as an "outtake" in case a follow-up is necessary
  * Create a detailed set of product requirements - this set of requirements can be saved as a work in-process as a template for future projects
