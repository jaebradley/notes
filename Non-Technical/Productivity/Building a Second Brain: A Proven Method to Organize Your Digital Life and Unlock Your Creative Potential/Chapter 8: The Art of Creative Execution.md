# Chapter 8: The Art of Creative Execution

## Divergence and Convergence

* The purpose of divergence is to generate new ideas
  * Process is necessarily spontaneous, chaotic, and messy
  * This is the time to wander
* Convergence forces us to eliminate options, make trade-offs, decide what is truly essential
  * Narrow the range of possibilities to make forward progress, and end up with a final result

## The Archipelago of Ideas

* Divergently gather a group of ideas, sources, points that form backbone of deliverable (like an essay)
* Build a critical mass of ideas to work with, then switch to convergence, linking ideas together in an order that makes sense

## Hemingway Bridge

* Hemingway would always end a writing session only when he knew what came next in the story - when the next plot point was clear
  * The next time he sat down to write, he knew exactly where to start
* At the end of a working session
  * Write down ideas for next steps
  * Write down the current status (current biggest challenge, most important open question, future roadblocks)
  * Write down any details you have in mind that are likely to be forgotten once you step away
  * Write intentions for next working session
  * Makes it easier to pick up the work in the next working session

## Dial Down the Scope

* When the full complexity of a project starts to reveal itself, most people choose to delay it
  * True of work projects, and even more true of side projects we take on in our spare time
  * We tell ourselves we need more time, but the delay ends up creating more problems (lose motivation, things get out of date, random life events, etc)
* Whatever you are building, there is a smaller, simpler version of it that would deliver much of the value in a fraction of the time
