# Chapter 3: how a Second Brain Works

* Capture (keep what resonabtes)
* Organize (save for actionability)
* Distill (find the essence)
* Express (show your work)

## Organize: Save for Actionability

* The best way to organize your notes is to organize for action
* Organize according to the active projects you are working on right now
* Consider new information in terms of its utility
  * "How is this going to help me move forward one of my current projects?"

## Distill: Find the Essence

* "How can I make this as useful as possible for my future self?"
* Don't think of self as _taker_ of notes but as a _giver_ of notes - giving easy-to-comprehend knowledge to future self

## Express: Show Your Work

* Information only becomes knowledge when we put it to use
* Shift as much time and effort from consuming to creating
