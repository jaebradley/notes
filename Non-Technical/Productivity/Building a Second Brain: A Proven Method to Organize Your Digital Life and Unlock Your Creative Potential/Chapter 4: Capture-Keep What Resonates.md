# Chapter 4: Capture-Keep What Resonates

* The meaning of a thought / insight / memory often isn't immediately clear
* Need to write them down, revisit them, view them from different perspectives to digest what they mean

## Twelve Favorite Problems

* Feynman kept favorite problems constantly present in his mind
* Every time you hear or read a new trick or new result test it against each of your twelve problems to see whether it helps
* Every once in a while there will be a hit
* Example favorite problems
  * How do I live less in the past and more in the present?
  * How do I build an investment strategy that is aligned with my mid-term and long-term goals and commitments?
* Favorite problems can stay fairly consistent over time
* Ask family / childhood friends what you were obsessed with as a kid - those same interests probably still fire your imagination as an adult

## Capture Criteria

* The biggest pitfall is saving too much
* Many of the notes people take are of ideas that they already know, already agree with, or could have guessed
* One definition of information: if you're not surprised but some piece of data, you already knew it at some level
  * Surprising information challenges our existing understanding and has the greatest potential to change how we think
* Does the information resonate - is your intuition telling you that something is noteworthy?
