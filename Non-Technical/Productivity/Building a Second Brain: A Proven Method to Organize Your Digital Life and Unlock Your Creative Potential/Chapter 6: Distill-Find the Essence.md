# Chapter 6: Distill-Find the Essence

* Potentially consider adding an "Executive Summary" at the top of a note, summarizing the article
* The best sign that additional distillation is needed is if a note needs to be visited multiple times
  * Either it is hard to comprehend or it is an important principle that needs to be better internalized

## Picasso's Secret

* Author brings up example of Picasso, who went from the drawing of a bull to the "essential form" of the bull (basically, a wire frame of the bull)
* Picasso couldn't have started with the single line drawing
* It was only after going through the exercise of stripping layers of the bull's form away, that he was able to get to the "essence" of the bull's form
* Paradoxically, the "simplicity" associated with this exercise makes it seem like anyone could have made it, but masks the effort needed to simplify
* This concept of "Progressive Summarization" (layers of summarization) is not a method for remembering as much as possible - it is a method for forgetting as much as possible

## Keep Your Future Self In Mind

* The true test of whether a note you've created is discoverable is whether you can get the gist of it at a glance
* Put it aside for a few days and set a reminder to revisit it once you've forgotten most of the details
