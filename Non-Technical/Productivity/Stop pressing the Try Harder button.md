# [Stop pressing the Try Harder button](https://www.neelnanda.io/blog/mini-blog-post-6-stop-pressing-the-try-harder-button)

* Planning is about ensuring the future goes the way I currently want it to
* Thinking about a task, and resolving to "Try Harder" never translated into action
* The error of "Pressing the Try Harder" button is a classic case of failing to be deliberate
* "Just trying harder" feels important, virtuous, and it's easy to think that "just trying harder" is what matters
* Trying harder is just a means to an end - goal is to ensure some task happens
* A good litmus test for whether you're pressing the "Just Try Harder" button is whether or not you'd be surprised that you never got around to accomplishing the task 2 weeks from now

### Some strategies to avoid relying on "Just Try Harder"

* Do it now, not later (set an X minute timer, see if you can finish the task)
  * Bottleneck is often simply starting
* Often times tasks feel overwhelming and not well-defined, so they are easier to ignore
  * By breaking a task into concrete next actions and steps, they become easier to tackle
* Schedule time for tasks
  * Another bottleneck is that the task does not feel urgent / other tasks that are seemingly "more important" serve as an avoidance strategy
