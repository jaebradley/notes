# [A Useful Productivity Measure?](https://www.jamesshore.com/v2/blog/2024/a-useful-productivity-measure)

## Product Bets

* Every engineering organization has more demand than capacity
* Product bet proposal - what we’re going to accomplish, estimated value generated, amount we’re willing to bet, value justification, how value will be measured
* In order for a proposal to be accepted, a Leadership team member needs to sponsor it, take accountability for its success, and convince other Leadership team members that their proposal is more important than all the others
* Each bet has a “maximum wager” - the number of engineeering days invested before giving up
* Wagers are 10x expected value over five years
* The time spent doing “maintenance” that don’t necessarily add value from a customer or user perspective - `muda` in Japanese
* If there wasn’t any `muda` and all time was spent on value-add work and achieved a 10x return on every investment, then the productivity metric would be easy (10x)
* If 20% of the time was `muda`-based then the productivity metric is 8x, etc etc
* % of engineering time spent on value-add activities is a proxy for productivity
* Conversation switched from “how can we get the stuff we want sooner” to “how can we decrease muda and spend more time on value-add work”
* Goodhart’s Law - when a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure
* It’s ridiculously easy to cheat the value-add capacity - just stop fixing bugs, defer needed upgrades, ignore security vulnerabilities, and there’s no `muda` any more
* `muda` / value-add metric only works when people are scrupulously honest
