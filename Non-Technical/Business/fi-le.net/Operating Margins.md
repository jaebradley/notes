# [Operating Margins](https://fi-le.net/margin/)
* Operating margin = company's income / company's revenue
* No coincidence that companies with high margins are the largest as the margins are what allowed them to grow in the first place
* The size of these large companies gives them pricing power and higher margins
* When analyzing operating margins want to weight by market cap
* Bulk of companies sit around 10% margins
* Quasi-monopolies
  * While it isn't illegal to try and compete with Nvidia or Mastercard (61% and 54% margins respectively) it's so capital-intensive to compete that they are effectively monopolies
* Franchisors are very profitable ("just slapping your name on things") as they don't have to actually operate any stores
* Examples of making products worth much more than the underlying raw materials
  * Tool manufacturers have 24% margins, presumably because they sell a specialized product that is built on lower raw material costs
