# [Running a Business Means Contact With Reality](https://fredkozlowski.com/2025/11/02/running-a-business-means-contact-with-reality/)
* To help learn more about running a business (especially marketing and sales), author created a service business with his mom
* Author assumed that releasing a product to the wild would lead to customers finding it and purchasing the product without many intermediary steps
* "Every single time the blindingly obvious thing that everyone was telling me to do turned out to be the correct move"
  * Adding a large call to action button on the webpage impacted conversions
* When it comes to sales: "most people are busy and are easily swayed to do what they were intending to do anyways"
* For the author, working on this business was an exercise in executing basic things, repeatedly
  * Business itself wasn't really complicated - difficult to do, but not difficult to understand. Most things were common sense.
* Business was iterative: crappy website, then better website, and author is remaking the website now
  * Author's opinion that this approach is strictly superior to trying to build the perfect website on the first try
* Next steps of business were obvious, usually involved optimizing business bottlenecks as they were identified
* "Working on only the things you like is impossible"
* It sucks when things aren't working, and you're not sure why
* It's hard to hire great people
* As a business owner, providing the service your business exists to provide is not your first priority (it's your second priority)
  * First priority is identifying and signing new business
