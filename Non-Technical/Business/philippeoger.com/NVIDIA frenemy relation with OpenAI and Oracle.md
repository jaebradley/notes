# [NVIDIA frenemy relation with OpenAI and Oracle](https://philippeoger.com/pages/deep-dive-into-nvidias-virtuous-cycle)
* NVIDIA reported $31.9 billion in net income and $23.8 billion in operating cash flow. So there's an $8 billion gap where profits aren't converting to cash immediately
* Inventory has doubled to $19.8 billion
  * Explanation is to prepare for the Blackwell launch but holding \~120 days of inventory seems like a capital drag
* As revenue increases, NVIDIA is waiting nearly two months to get paid, suggesting that it is extending credit to enterprise clients

## Circular financing
* Leg 1: NVIDIA pledges billions to OpenAI
* Leg 2: OpenAI signs $300 billion cloud contract with Oracle to host its models
* Leg 3: To fulfill that contract, Oracle places a $40 billion order for NVIDIA GPUs
* If NVIDIA stopped investing in OpenAI, would OpenAI still have the cash to sign the Oracle deal? And would Oracle still buy the GPUs from NVIDIA? If the answer is no, then some of the revenue may be more fragile than it looks

## OpenAI is trying to decrease dependency on NVIDIA
* OpenAI bought DRAM wafers directly from Samsung bypassing NVIDIA's supply chain
* OpenAI has hired more hardware engineers
* Guess is that OpenAI plans to use NVIDIA GPUs to create models, but then run those models on custom silicon
* Questions are: where is the money that OpenAI is planning to use to fund this? How much influence does NVIDIA have over OpenAI's future plans

## Groq acquisition
* One of the biggest bottlenecks for NVIDIA is high bandwidth memory
* Groq's architecture relies on static RAM
* SRAM is typically built in different fabs than the specialized ones used to build high bandwidth memory, so SRAM shouldn't face the same supply chain crunch that HBM does
* Buying Groq is a supply-chain hedge: it's not necessarily a faster chip, but it is a chip that is available when everything else is sold out
