# [How good are decisions? Evaluating decision quality in domains where evaluation is easy](https://danluu.com/bad-decisions/)

## Baseball

* Example details the persistence of “inefficient” strategies in baseball
* The introduction of data-driven decisions as a cultural change, and cultural change is slow
* The volatility and skepticism of radical ideas heavily disincentives going against conventional wisdom
* There is more randomness for winning the World Series than making the playoffs since there is a much larger sample of games necessary to qualify for the playoffs vs. winning the World Series

## Board games

* Author finds low-ranked players confidently argue that their position is correct
* Even though players have evidence that they are wrong (losing often) and then they have an ELO rating that tells them how good they approximately are (relative to other players)
* Most boardgames have a 1v1 aspect, so unlike video games, can’t blame other people and 1v1 games is about as accurate a metric as you’ll get for someone’s domain-specific decision making skill

## Life outside of games

* Sports and boardgames provide the clearest evidence of decision making, and yet decision making in sport and board games is poor
* In fields where it’s more difficult to determine the true value of decisions, it may make a while for “good” decision making to surface, unless there’s something about the structure of baseball (sports) that makes it particularly difficult to remove a poor decision making and insert a better decision maker
* The paradigm shift of using data effectively to drive decisions has been hitting different fields at different rates over the past few decades across industries
* Author posits an interesting product question - there are probably more competitive professional baseball teams than competitive products in a given product market
