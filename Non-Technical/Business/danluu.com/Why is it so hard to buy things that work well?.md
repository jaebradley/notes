# [Why is it so hard to buy things that work well?](https://danluu.com/nothing-works/)
* Author contends the following "truisms" are not so true
  * “Markets enforce efficiency so it’s not possible for a company to have a major inefficiency and survive”
  * "Companies / products are basically as good as possible, or else someone would’ve outcompeted them already"
* Author’s anectdotal experience of experts checking the work of people they’ve hired for things like home renovation or accounting have found errors in the work
* Expensive local accountants are not much better than small, cheap, local accountants
  * Good accountants are typically somewhat expensive, but they’re generally not charging the highest rate, and only a small percentage of somewhat expensive accountants are good
* Individual firms exploiting mispriced labor have a limited demand for labor, and these labor market inefficiencies can persist for decades
  * Example used is Greenspan economic consulting firm that hired a disproportionate amount of women
* Outsourcing work to “experts” leads to unsatisfactory results from both a time perspective and a support perspective
* Large support contracts can often cost more than an engineer while delivering worse service than an engineer
* Many years ago, high-performance CPUs were an example of something absurd to build in-house, but Apple and Amazon have been able to produce best in-class CPUs for their respective use-cases
* The pervasiveness of technical decisions made without serious technical considerations (like migrating to open source software that is less efficient and will require higher capex and opex) is a major reason why selection pressure on companies to make good products is weak
  * Example is Mongo, where they have loudly repeated bogus performance / correctness claims which has proved to be a superior business strategy than focusing on correctness and performance
* It's rare that people are willing to expend a significant amount of personal capital to do the right thing, whatever that means to someone, but it's even rarer that the leadership of a firm will make that choice and spend down the firm's capital to do the right thing.
* In American society, people think that someone who gets the raw end of a deal because they failed to protect themselves against every possible contingency “deserves” what happened
  * Laptop stolen at cafe; not reading every word of the terms of service updates
* Support contracts are often times worded in ways to make the contract meaninless
* Legally enforcing contracts is expensive and the resolution of companies regularly violating their SLAs is to terminate the contract rather than pursue legal action because the cost of legal action wouldn’t be worth anything that could be gained
* If you work for a monopoly, there’s much less incentive to make a better product since the company’s not going to be any more successful
  * In these monopolies, the people that make the company more successful are sales/marketing and they end up running the company
  * Product people get driven out of the decision making process, and the company forgets what it means to build great products
