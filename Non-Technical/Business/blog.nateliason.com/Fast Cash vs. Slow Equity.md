# [Fast Cash vs. Slow Equity](https://blog.nateliason.com/p/fast-cash-slow-equity)

* Cash business: reliable cash flow, limited long-term value
  * Easier to compete with, hard to scale past a certain revenue number
* Equity business: considerably longer to hit certain cash flow numbers, but earnings are more durable
* Cash businesses can have quick, linear growth. Equity businesses have slower, but (eventually) exponential growth
* Find a cash business that pays the bills
  * Only invest enough time to keep it humming
  * Don't try to scale it past the sustenance level
  * Use it as a cushion to work on an equity business that could really scale
