# [Seek Ideas At The Right Level of Abstraction](https://commoncog.com/the-right-level-of-abstraction/)

* Author wrote article when they first moved to Vietnam about betting on Asia (for a number of reasons)
* Author’s article wasn’t mistaken, but author was too “small” to take advantage of any of these shifts
* Author argues this is an instance of thinking at the wrong level of abstraction
* Buffet and Munger’s Noah Rule: “predicting rain doesn’t count, building an ark does”
* Author’s metaphor is that pointing out the storm clouds on the horizon and telling everybody about the coming thunderstorm doesn’t matter if you don’t have carpentry skills
* If you can’t take advantage of the analyses then it is a waste of time

## Reasoning at the Wrong Level

* Author is approached by students with macro-economic theses
* Author believes these are wasteful attempts at thinking
* Students are better served by answering questions at a lower level of abstraction: “What are my career goals, and what companies should I work at to achieve those goals” along with “What are the market/regulartory/economic (macro) shifts that are affecting those companies directory?”

## An Appreciation For Complext Adaptive Systems

* Many of the systems we operate in are complex adaptive systems
* Complex - because they consist of many interweaving parts
* Adaptive - because they consiste of many agents that compete, cooperate, and adapt to each other
* They are system, because these interconnected elements are coherently organized
* Examples of complex adaptive systems are the brain, immune system, ecologies, cells, political parties, etc
* First crucial property is that many agents act in parallel - nerve cells in the brain, etc
* Control is dispersed. No master neuron in brain.
* Many levels of organization with agents at any level serving as building blocks for agents at a higher level
* Groups of cells form a tissue, groups of tissues form an organ, groups of organs form an organism, etc
* Complex adaptive systems are constantly revising and rearranging their building blocks as they gain experience (brain learns, firms reshuffle organizational chart)
* Complex adaptive systems typically have many niches, where each niche can be filled by an agent who has a competitive advantage in that niche
* The very act of filling one niche can open up more niches
* As an agent in any of these systems, the amount of analysis needed to grok all moving parts of the system is monumental - so monumental that unless you are responsible for the entire system, you should probably second-guess any attempt to do so (is it really necessary to understand the whole system, given my goals?)
* Rules at one level of the system don’t necessarily apply to different levels of the same system
* Example: rules for effective learning emerge from, but have little relationship to the rules of neuroplasticity
* Good businessmen may be able to predict, out-think, outcompete other businesses in their niches, but their mental models may not map perfectly to the type of thinking needed to shape an economy
* Just because a set of ideas works for one level of a system does not automatically make it relevant to the level of organization above it
* Author’s example: neuroplasticity tells us that the brain changes in response to learning, but it doesn’t necessarily tell us how to learn better or what pedagogical techniques work best for effective learning.
* So neuroplasticity operates at the wrong level of abstraction for learning / pedagogical insight. Need to go a level up to cognitive science (psychology)

## Applications

* Be suspicious of ideas that are taken from one level of a complex adaptive system and then applied to a higher / lower level. Likely these rules won’t be as useful as you might imagine them to be
* When reasoning about your career, think one level above and one level below
* When thinking about your career, pay more attention to proximal causes
* As an individual contributor (for example, a software engineer) you might want to pay attention to shifts at the organizational level above you, but you probably shouldn’t be paying too much attention to the macro-environment shifts that might affect the company at large
* It might sound smart to say “because the government’s coming after the company for anti-trust reasons, so I’m going to leave the company” but in reality, certain departments in the company might “win” in such an event while others might lose
* It may be that it’s more difficult to see what results in a net win for your career
* As a CEO it is very worth it to pay attention to regulatory shifts, as this is one level “above” your position
* There are obviously remote causes that would directly affect every level of a system (war, global pandemic)
* The goal is not “seek ideas at the right level of abstraction and discard everything that’s potentially remote or low level” but rather recognizing that “only looking at remote levels to calculate optimal action” is itself a failure mode
* And this failure mode is a particularly pernicious trap for smart, analytical people
* Narrative stereotype that geniuses extrapolate from high-level analyses to individual action, and thus we must do the same
* Example: Peter Gregory in Silicon Valley extrapolating breeding cycles of cicadas to price movements of sesame seed futures
