# [The Games People Play With Cash Flow](https://commoncog.com/cash-flow-games/)

## The Setup

* Arguments don’t have three terminal truth values (right, maybe, wrong) but instead of many possible truth values (“got the details wrong, but is by-and-large correct”, “correct but for a different level of abstraction”)

## Author’s synopsis of argument for why startups shouldn’t raise money
* Startups are risky
* Raising capital for a startup reduces skin in the game
* Once you have less skin in the game, it is easier to make bad decisions - due to having a capital buffer, and having more time to waste
* Foregoing raising venture capital and creating a sustainable business from the beginning and growing linearly with the number of people that give you money for your product
* Incentive alignment - grow only by solving customer problems that they pay you for
* Will pick shortest path possible to solve these problems because you don’t have the luxury of time given by infusion of other people’s money
* Author could not find anything explicitly wrong with the argument
* Unease stemmed from experience - that they “knew” that this wasn’t the right way to think about raising capital but they couldn’t construct an argument that went against it
* Author uses this argument as an example of a subtle logical error: “perfectly rational, logically constructed, and not *wrong*, but not as useful or as powerful as some other framing”
* Author thinks ensorial.com author’s set of starting axioms come from a deficient understanding of business
* People with limited understanding of business think that business is all about making profits, but those running business know that running a business is all about managing cash flows

## John Malone and the Invention of EBITDA

* John Malone took the position of CEO of TCI (a cable company) in 1972
* Malone noticed some things about the cable industry
* Highly predictable subscription revenues, low cancellation rate
* Cable franches were effectively a local monopoly and cable system operators had limited competition once established in a given locale
* Favorable tax characteristics by using debt to build new systems (sheltering cash flow from taxes), aggressively depreciating the costs of construction
* Cable market was high growth - subscriber counts would grow 20x from the 60s to the 70s
* Because Malone leveraged debt to finance acquisitions as a tax deferrment mechanism, TCI wouldn’t show a profit (and show a loss for nearly 25 years)
* Malone came up wtih a new accounting metric called EBITDA (“Earnings before interest, depreciation, and taxes”)
* TCI had high interest payments and big (depreciation) write-offs on cable equipment, producing losses
* These losses meant it paid hardly any taxes to the government
* As long as TCI collected predictable, monopoly income from customers, meeting interest payments, and grew from acquisitions, there was no point in worrying
* These tax-sheltered cash flows could be leveraged to generate more loans to create more tax-sheltered cash flows
* AT&T bought TCI in 1998 for $48 billion (30.3% compound return to TCI shareholders)

## The Games People Play With Cash Flow

* The core idea isn’t “it’s possible to build a valuable company with no accounting profits” but that 1. there are games people play with cash flow and 2. cash flow is more important (valuable) to grok than profits
* Malone’s entire strategy was built around that cable systems have a high upfront fixed cost, but then produce a stable stream of long-term revenue
* The extreme nature of upfront capital drove Malone to embrace debt over other sources of capital
* Saas business models are close proxies for the cable system business model
* High upfront capital cost to build the software (engineers) and then sell it to customers (sales and marketing teams) before customers pay stable stream of cash for years and years
* So the real reason to raise money is due to the temporal nature of cash flows - in many businesses you must spend money now to make money later

### Example of customer discounts in exchange for earlier payments - “need the cash”

* Large inventory means that a large chunk of capital has been allocated to a (relatively) illiquid asset
* Need liquidity to pay for expenses, etc
* So discount for earlier payments is the price he’s willing to pay in order to unlock that cash flow

### The Effects of Speed on Cash Flow

* Guaranteeing fast, consistent delivery times from factory to downstream distributors means that they may hold less inventory, which in turn means that they would have a better cash position
* Can charge a higher price (and thus have higher margins, while taking market share away from your competitors)
* Distributors will prefer to hold your product over a competitor’s given the better cash flow (they are required to have less illiquid inventory on hand at any given time)

### Pre-payments in the Restaurant Industry

 * Restauranteur started charging for a deposit on reservations
 * They had a float, a bank account with a lot of capital
 * They used the float to call up vendors and prepay them for next X months
 * By prepaying for items (like beef) they were able to get assets for half the price, if prepaid months in advance
 * In the beef example, the butcher has 35 days to sell the beef, and after 35 days, only a handful of places will buy it, and then after 60 days the butcher has to sell it for $1 a pound as dog food

## Raising Capital…From First Principles

* Only three ways to raise capital - 1. sell equity 2. take on debt (selling bonds, convertible note) 3. retained earnings (cash generated by the business and reinvest it back into the business)
* Whether you should raise capital or not is a function of the cash flow characteristics of your business, and the type of business you’re trying to build
* Equal parts life questions like “do you want to work enough to generate enough cash to buy you freedom?” and business questions like “is your business very capital intensive?”
* You never know if the set of axioms you’re building an argument with is fully complete - best you can do is “this analysis looks good, let’s wait and see if it actually ends up being correct”
