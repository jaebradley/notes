# [The Brain Science Behind Aging and Forgetting](https://medium.com/wise-well/the-brain-science-behind-aging-and-forgetting-1954c5c094ab)

* Forgetting plays an essential role in maintaining cognitive health
  * An intelligent memory system not only remembers information but also actively forgets whatever is no longer useful
* When you are young, you can generate lots of facts - when you are old, you know what they mean and how to use them
  
## Inconsistent Memories

* After the Challenger space shuttle explosion, researches asked a group of 44 college students about their knowledge of the event
* 3 years later, researchers asked the same participants the identical questions and compared their answers
* Nobody correctly remembered the answers to all their questions and 25% of them did not correctly remember any of their answers
* You can be 100% confident in your memories and be 100% wrong

## Senior Brains Struggles

* Trying to remember something you need to do in the future takes a hit with aging (prospective memory)
* Trying to remember something for a short period of time takes a hit (working memory)

## Senior Brains Shine

* Older adults are better at retaining information they've learned (semantic memory)
  * People maintain and grow their vocabulary
  * Seniors are better Scrabble players and often excel in foreign languages
* Older people outpace their younger peers when it comes to combining and utilizing complex ideas
  * People in their 40s and beyond excel at using the concepts they've learned and expressing them to others
  * Using complex concepts is a sign of _crystallized intelligence_
    * Knowledge that is stored and accumulated over time
    * With continued learning and socialization, crystallized intelligence can increase over a person's life
