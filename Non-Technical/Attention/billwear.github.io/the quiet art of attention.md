# [the quiet art of attention](https://billwear.github.io/attention.html)

* Begin by paying attention to what our mind does, its wandering, its anxieties, its compulsions
* Space, however small, between thoughts
* In that space, given patience, we can decide how to respond rather than being dragged along by impulse or fear
* Act intentfully, not reflexively
* Much of what occupies our thoughts is unnecessary, filled with concerns that seem urgent, but donâ€™t end up serving our deeper well-being
* The most complex of undertakings becomes simple, not because it is easy, but because we have allowed it to unfold naturally, one step after another
* Repetition of small action, build strength, that builds habits of the mind
* Living well requires presence
* Focussing on one thing deeply is to experience it fully
* Even the simplest of tasks takes on a new significance when approached with care and attention
* The mind needs patience and consistency
* Days when old habits return and focus feels elusive are also part of the process
