# [How Superhuman Built an Engine to Find Product Market Fit](https://review.firstround.com/how-superhuman-built-an-engine-to-find-product-market-fit/)

* Various definitions of product-market fit
  * "When users spontaneously tell other people to use your product"
* Leading indicator question: “how would you feel if you could no longer use the product?” and measure the % who answer “very disappointed”
  * Companies that struggled to grow almost always had less than 40% of users respond with “very disappointed”
  * Example is 51% of Slack users in 2015 that answered they would be very disappointed without Slack
* In comparison, when Superhuman polled their low-hundreds number of users, only 22% of users said they would be very disappointed
* Superhuman asked the “very disappointed” group the type of person they think would benefit most from the product, knowing that, most likely, these users would describe themselves
* Superhuman then crafted a persona for this “high-expectation customer”
* Politely disregard those who would not be disappointed without your product
  * They are so far from loving you that they are essentially a lost cause
* Segmented on the “somewhat disappointed group”, for whom “speed” was a main benefit
  * “Speed” being the main benefit that high-expectation / "very disappointed if Superhuman disappeared" customer
  * For this segment, the biggest response for improving Superhuman was a mobile app
  * That's how Superhuman made decision to focus on mobile
