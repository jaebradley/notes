# [If nothing is curated, how do we find things?](https://tadaima.bearblog.dev/if-nothing-is-curated-how-do-we-find-things/)
* Social media creates the illusion of convenience
* It takes time to "stay on top" of things - music, film, etc
* So instead of relying on professional curators to sort through things, we have to do the sorting
* Algorithsm will never surprise you with something different
* "Oh yeah, I'll have to see it [a recommended show/movie/music] but my list is so long"
* In reality, we're not going to watch it, because we feel like we don't have time to go through everything and we don't fully trust other people's recommendations
* Curation is valuable - we need critics to devote their lives to browsing through the pile and telling us what is worht our time and what isn't
* While critics still exist, they publish dozens of articles per day, trying to get as many clicks and pageviews as possible
