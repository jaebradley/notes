# [You Are What You Read, Even If You Don’t Always Remember It](https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2024/you-are-what-you-read/)

* Goal of a book isn’t to get to the last page, it’s to expand your thinking
* Feels like if you can’t measure (or remember) the impact of a book, then it wasn’t worth reading
* Emerson: “I cannot remember the books I’ve read any more than the meals I have eaten; even so, they have made me”
* You are what you read, even if you don’t always remember it
