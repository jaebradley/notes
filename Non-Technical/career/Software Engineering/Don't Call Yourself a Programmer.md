# [Don't Call Yourself A Programmer](https://www.kalzumeus.com/2011/10/28/dont-call-yourself-a-programmer/)

## Engineers are hired to create business value, not to program things

* Most software is boring one-off applications in corporations - it solves business problems
* It can solve business problems despite being soul-crushingly boring and of minimal technical complexity
* It only matters if it either saves company costs or generates additional revenue
* Status in well-run business generally is awarded to people who successfully take credit for either increasing revenue or reducing costs
 * Note the term "taking credit" - regardless of it it entails them actually doing those things
* The only goal is adding revenue and / or reducing costs
 * Producing beautiful software is not the goal, solving complex technical problems is not the goal, writing bug-free code is not the goal
* There are profit centers, which makes the company money and then there are cost centers, which are everybody else
  * You want to be attached to profit centers, because it will bring you higher wages / respect / opportunities
  * If you can't work in a profit center at a company, work elsewhere or engineer your transfer to a profit center after joining the company

## Donâ€™t call yourself a programmer

* Describe yourself by what you have accomplished for previous employers around increasing revenues or reducing costs
 * For example: "wrote the backend billing code that 97% of Google's revenue passes through"
* Job interview is a transaction
 * You are not their friend, you're an input for an industrial process which they are trying to buy for the company at the lowest price

## Obtaining Employment

* Most jobs are never available publicly, just like most worthwhile candidates are not available publicly
 * This is disproportionally true of jobs you actually want
 * No high-profile jobs are obtained by sending a cover letter to an HR department
* Position information is something like: word of mouth => introductions => meetings => job offer => then resume / HR / formal offer dance begins
* Job tip: don't want to be first employee of startup - be last co-founder

## Compensation

* The question is not "how much money do engineers make" but "what kind of offers do engineers routinely work for?"
 * Salary is only one of the many levers that people use to motivate other people
* Be comfortable counteroffering around benefits you care about other than money
 * If they can't go higher on salary, then talk about vacation instead

## Equity Grant Pessimism

* People radically overestimate likelihood that startup succeeds
* Also radically overestimate portion of pie that will be allocated to them if startup succeeds (dilution, liquidation preferences)

## Pros and Cons of Working at a Startup

* Working at a startup, you tend to meet people doing startups
 * Most of them will not be able to hire you in two years
* Working at a large corportation, you tend to meet other people in large corporations
 * Many of them will either be able to hire you or will have the ear of someone able to hire you in two years
* Working in a startup is a career path, but more than that, a lifestyle choice like working in investment banking or academia
* If you only enjoy certain bits of the startup lifestyle, can work at megacorps that engage in the bits you enjoy
 * For example, megacorps invest in working on cutting-edge technology, assuming it creates value for them

## The Importance of Communication

* The dominant quality which gets you jobs is the ability to give people the perception that you will create value
* Some of the best programmers are weak at communicating
 * People end up disproportionally not wanting to work with them or undervaluing their ability to create value
* Conversely, author says that people assume he is among the best engineers because
 * There exists evidence that he is technical
 * He is able to write and speak very well
* Answer "how good of a programmer are you?" with business examples / implementation for delivering value
* One key sub-skill is being able to quickly, concisely, and confidently explain how you create value to someone who is not an expert in your field

## At least in a professional setting, modesty is against your interests

* If you feel poorly about not being modest, you're like a batter who feels poorly about stealing bases in baseball
* You're not morally superior, you're just playing poorly

## Image Matters

* Dressing appropriately, maintaining a professional appearance, speaking in a confident tone all matter
