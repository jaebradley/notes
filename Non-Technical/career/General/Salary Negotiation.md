# [Salary Negotiation](https://www.kalzumeus.com/2012/01/23/salary-negotiation/)

## Employer Mental Model of Negotiation

* See employees like employers see them - cost of an employee is not just salary, but taxes, benefits package, healthcare, "perks", job ads, etc.
  * "Fully-loaded cost" of employee is generally between 150-200% of salary
  * So companies are not sensitive to small differences in employee wage so $5,000 difference to HR => "Even after we kick in the extra taxes, that is only about 3% of their fully-loaded cost for this year, or seven-hundredths of one percent of that team's hiring budget"
* Recruiters are not spending the recruiter's money - they're spending their budget

## Ideal Job Search Strategy

* Establish reputation in field
* Hiring manager talks to you about an opening that they want you to fill
* Let them take a stab at what a mutually fulfilling offer looks like
* Give hiring manager resume to send to HR for their records
 * Resumes are an institution created to mean that no one has to read resumes
* Even the most established companies have hiring practices that are sourced by using informal networks and interpersonal connections
* Virtually no company has a hiring process which is accurately explained by blog posts about the company

## Negotiation Strategy

* Negotiating never makes worthwhile offers worse
  * For exploding offers, refuse them and deal with people who are willing to be professionals - you're not a peasant
  * Do not start negotiating until you already have a `Yes-If` (Yes, if we agree on terms)
  * Do not start negotiating from `No-But` (No, but we might hire you anyway if you're really really cheap)
  * Any discussion of compensation prior to hearing `Yes-If` is premature
* Try and have salary negotiation over email vs. in real time
 * Email gives arbitrary time to prepare responses, less likely to be at a disadvantage when talking with an experienced negotiator

## Never give a number first

 * When people with hiring authority think of winners, they think of people like them who live and breathe this business thing
  * They negotiate things on principle - that is a major portion of the value they bring to the company
  * Poorly negotiating will cause them to retroactively question competencies they'd previously credited you with

### "I really need a number to move the process forward"

* "I'm more concerned at the moment with talking to you about discovering whether we're a mutual fit. If we're a great fit, then I can be flexible on the numbers with you, and you can be flexible on the numbers with me. If we're not a great fit, then the numbers are ultimately irrelevant, because your company only hires A players and I only work at roles I would be an A player at"

### "This form needs a number"

* "Give me git access and I'll fix it in a jiffy! Seriously, speaking, I'm more concerned at the moment with discovering whether we're a mutual fit...Oh it's physically impossible? Put in $1 then to get the ball rolling, and we'll circle back later to this"

### "I can't move forward without a number"

* Add 5-10% to package value of current compensation

## Interview Process Tips

* Keep notes throughout the interview process
 * If company volunteers they've been interviewing for six months, during salary negotiation can bring that up by saying "this is an opportunity to get this position filled without delaying your business by another six months"
 * Write down hard numbers (like salary, vacation days, etc.)
* Conversely, don't say stupid things like "I need this job"
  * You never need a job - being needy means that the party who is not needy has automatic leverage over you
* Conversation tip - phrase things as "we", "mutual wins", etc.
* Try to phrase things positively rather than score debating points - "you just said X, but that is contradicted by earlier statement y" vs. "good good, but taking into account your earlier concerns about y"

## Research

* Who do they value within the company? Roles? Titles? Groups?
* What does the career path look like for successful people within the company?
* What are their compensation levers? And how do they operate them?
 * Some firms are more excepting of option grants vs. salary increases
* What are the projects this company thinks are really key to its future and how would a motivated person go about getting on them?
* Somebody wanted to negotiate more money from a Google job offer - came back with reply that Google food benefit was worth a significant amount of money
* If they say "We can't see our way to $X"
 * "At my last company, I increased sales by %y - what would a 1% increase in sales be worth? Millions right? Considereing that this is conceivably worth millions to you, we'd be silly not to do business together"
* `Interesting` is a wonderful word - it is positive and non-commital at the same time. If they tell you a number, tell them it is an interesting number, not a wonderful number
* Other compensation benefits (if salary negotiation is really off the table) are vacation days, work hours, project assignments, travel opportunities, professional development opportunities
