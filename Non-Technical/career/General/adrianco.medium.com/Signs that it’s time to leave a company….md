* Founder-led companies often have problems maintaining their innovation culture when the founder moves on
* Bezos was focussed on keeping "Day 1" culture at Amazon
* Once Bezos left, it's clear that it's now "Day 2" with more politics and micromanagement
* The right thing to do coming out of lockdown would have been to write down the new Amazon HQ2 real estate investment
  * Instead, Amazon management cares more about real estate than the product
  * Customers don't care what the company's buildings are like
  * Using RTO to drive people out of the company without firing them
