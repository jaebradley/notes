# [A forty-year career.](https://lethain.com/forty-year-career/)

## Pace

* Biggest barrier to a forty year career is burnout
  * Work on work you find meaningful
  * Manage your pace
* If work anxiety is a constant companion, then change your situation even if it feels like a step back in the short-term

## People

* If you're struggling to build your network, spend time at a couple of large companies
* You'll organically meet hundreds or thousands of folks, who will scatter over time across the industry

## Profit

* People generally underestimate their employability
  * Job switching process takes longer for increasingly senior roles
* Best roles are only accessible if you're already financially stable

## Learning

* In hypergrowth roles, there is little time for deep reflection
  * Working on dozens of concurrent problems, not necessarily developing mastery, but building familiarity
* Each year pick personal and professional goals
* Learning doesn't come just from doing new things - it also requires time carved out to reflect on how you did those new things and how you might adjust your future approach
  * Space to reflect is a precursor to improvement
