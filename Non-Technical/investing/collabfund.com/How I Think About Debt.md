# [How I Think About Debt](https://collabfund.com/blog/how-i-think-about-debt/)

* Japan has 140 businesses that are 500+ years old
* A few businesses claim to have been operating continuosly for 1k+ years
* These businesses are called `shinise` and they hold a ton of cash and no debt
* “Debt defines your future, and when your future is defined, hope begins to die”
* With no debt, the range of volatile events you can withstand throughout life might fall within a relatively wide range
* More debt, and the range shrinks, etc
* Debt is typically viewed as a tool to pull forward demand and leverage assets, where the only downside is cost of capital (interest rate)
* Odds that an extreme event occurs in the next N years (where N is large)  is very high
* Having optionality and flexibility is also an asset that debt constrains
