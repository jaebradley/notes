# [Why the 2% inflation target?](https://sites.lsa.umich.edu/mje/2023/09/04/why-the-2-inflation-target/)

## New Zealand

* In 1989, New Zealand defined an inflation target
* Initially, inflation target was 0 to 1% but was pushed up to 2% to give more wiggle room
* Once the central bank stated a 2% inflation target, everybody assumed inflation would eventually become 2% as the central bank could use monetary policy to change the inflation rate
* In 1989, the inflation rate in New Zealand was 7.6%. In 1991 it was 2%

## US

* US was having an inflation rate target at the same time as New Zealand
* Fed Chair Volcker favored an inflation rate of 0 to 1%
* Fed Chair Yellen favored a higher inflation target that would allow the Fed to take greater action if there was a recession
  * If there was a recession and the inflation rate was already low, there would be a higher risk of deflation
  * Deflation may be worse in the long run
    * People don't invest or spend money as they get a return for doing nothing, leading to even less spending, leading to higher unemployment and lower growth, creating more deflation, ultimately creating an recession cycle
* Fed Chair Bernanke made the 2% inflation target official in 2012
* Inflation targeting is an effective framework for delivering low inflation, anchoring inflation expectations, and lowering inflation volatility
  * Achieved without any adverse effects on output and interest volatility
* Even if 2% is not the "right" number, if the Fed does change the inflation target, it loses credibility
  * This trust is important because if you don't believe the target is real / the Fed is committed to ensuring inflation meets the target, this may lead to cycles of inflation
  * If you believe inflation will be higher soon, you will buy a lot of stuff now when prices are relatively lower
  * Other people will believe this too and will race to buy goods/services which will lead to lower supply and higher prices
