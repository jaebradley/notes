# Chapter 2: A Tale of Two High Jumpers

## Chess

* ~11k hours to become a chess master
* One player reached master level in 3k hours
  * Another player needed 23k hours
  * Some people need to practice 8x more to reach the same level as someone else
* Small individual differences in talent at the beginning may have a huge effect long term
* If we assume some "chunk" of learning takes ~10 seconds, and you need ~300k chunks to become a GM
  * If you learn a chunk in 9 seconds and somebody else learns it in 11 seconds, those small differences could lead to dramatically different outcomes
