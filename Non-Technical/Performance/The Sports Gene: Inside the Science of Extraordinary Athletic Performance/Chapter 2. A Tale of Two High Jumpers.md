# Chapter 2: A Tale of Two High Jumpers

## Chess

* ~11k hours to become a chess master
* One player reached master level in 3k hours
  * Another player needed 23k hours
  * Some people need to practice 8x more to reach the same level as someone else
* Small individual differences in talent at the beginning may have a huge effect in long-term learning rate
* If we assume some "chunk" of learning takes ~10 seconds, and you need ~300k chunks to become a GM
  * If you learn a chunk in 9 seconds and somebody else learns it in 11 seconds, those small differences could lead to dramatically different outcomes

## High Jumping

* One jumper (Holm) put in extreme levels of effort and training
* The other jumper won the NCAA indoor high jump championship after 8 months of training and headed to the Olympics
* Thomas had long legs relative to his height and was gifted with giant Achilles tendons
* Long Achilles tendons are important for jumping
  * Not significantly impacted by training, but rather a function of the distance between the calf muscle and heel bone
* While an individual can increase tendon stiffness through training, there is evidence that tendon stiffness is partly influenced by an individual's genes that build collagen
* Studies of athletes have tended to find that the top competitors require far less than 10k hours of deliberate practice to reach elite status

## The Matthew Effect

* Subjects who did well from the start, improved faster as the training progressed
* Positive correlation between high initial ability and the ability to profit by training
* People tend to converge on skill level (with practice) for easy tasks, like clicking buttons
* In more complex scenarios, individual differences increase
* The fastest checkout clerk with 10 years experience will still be about 3x faster than the slowest person with the same level of experience
