# Chapter 1: Beat by and Underhand Girl

* Example of softball player pitching against professional baseball players successfully
* Fifth of a second is about the minimum time that it takes the retina to receive information and for that information to be conveyed across synapses and for the brain to send a message to the spinal cord to put muscles into action
* Major league fastball travels 10 feet in the 75 milliseconds it takes the retina to confirm that a baseball is in view
  * Entire flight of the baseball takes 400 milliseconds
	* Since it takes about half that time to initiate muscular action, batters need to know where to swing shortly after the ball has left the pitcher's hand
  * Window for making contact with the ball (i.e. ball is in reach of bat) is 5 milliseconds
  * Humans don't have a visual system fast enough to track the ball as the angular position of the ball relative to the hitter's eyes changes so rapidly
* The reaction times of elite athletes always hovered around one fifth of a second
  * Same as the reaction times of random people
* Study that showed slides of volleyball plays where ball was in frame and also where ball had just left the frame
  * Top volleyball players were then shown the slides for a fraction of a second
	* They needed to decide whether the ball was in or out of the frame
	* Testing whether players were seeing the court and player body language in a different way from the average person
	* A fraction of a second glance was all top players needed to determine whether the ball was present
	* Example is a setter from the Canadian national team who was able to deduce whether or not the volleyball was present in a picture flashed for 16 milliseconds
	* Elite athletes learned how to perceive the game rather than just the raw ability to react quickly
	* Able to reproduce results with elite field hockey players
	* Every elite athlete seemed to miraculously have a photographic memory when it came to their sport
