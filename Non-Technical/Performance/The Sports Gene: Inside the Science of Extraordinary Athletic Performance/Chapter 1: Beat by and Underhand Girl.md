# Chapter 1: Beat by and Underhand Girl

* Example of softball player pitching against professional baseball players successfully
* Fifth of a second is about the minimum time that it takes the retina to receive information and for that information to be conveyed across synapses and for the brain to send a message to the spinal cord to put muscles into action
* Major league fastball travels 10 feet in the 75 milliseconds it takes the retina to confirm that a baseball is in view
  * Entire flight of the baseball takes 400 milliseconds
	* Since it takes about half that time to initiate muscular action, batters need to know where to swing shortly after the ball has left the pitcher's hand
  * Window for making contact with the ball (i.e. ball is in reach of bat) is 5 milliseconds
  * Humans don't have a visual system fast enough to track the ball as the angular position of the ball relative to the hitter's eyes changes so rapidly
* The reaction times of elite athletes always hovered around one fifth of a second
  * Same as the reaction times of random people
