# Chapter 7: The Big Bang of Body Types

* Biomechanical video analysis of Jesse Owens shows that his joints moved as fast in the 1930s as Carl Lews moved in the 1980s
   * Owens ran on cinder tracks which stole more energy than the synthetic surfaces where Lewis set his records
* BOZ is the probability that a person randomly selected from the general public has a physique that could possibly fit into a given sport at the elite level
* In the NFL, one extra centimeter of height or 6.5 pounds on average translates to $45k in extra income
* Professions that require unique physiques have an even more winner-take-all structure
  * BOZ for catwalk models is less than 8%, 5% for international models, and 0.5% for super models
* Bench press is much easier for men with shorter arms, while longers arms are better for everything on the actual football field
  * So drafting an NFL player for his bench press strength may actually be evaluating a player with the undesirable physical trait of short arms
* One reason that marathon runners tend to be smaller is because small humans have a larger skin surface area to volume
  * This means that they dissipate heat better
  * Heat dissipation is critical for endurance performance because the central nervous system forces a slowdown or complete stop of effort when the body's core temperature passes about 104 degrees
  * Case study of the relatively tall marathon runner Paula Radcliffe - 8-0 in cool/temperate marathos and 0-2 in the summer Olympic races
* Adults with a high proportion of fast-twitch fibers / lower proportion of slow-twitch fibers can pack on muscle, more difficulty losing fat
* Fat is primarily burned as part of the energy-making process that occurs in slow-twitch muscle fibers
* Study found that each kilogram of bone supports a maximum of five kilograms of muscle - in other words, five-to-one is the general limit of human muscle to bone
* Shot put - athlete doesn't need to move far so even adding extra fat might be worthwhile, since the athlete needs to pack on bulk to become relatively more massive than the object being thrown
* Javelin - the athlete needs to run fast and throw hard, so should be wary of trying to add weight beyond the five-to-one ratio, as the extra weight will likely be fat
* Athletic records have slowly inched forward (or not at all) - the men's mile / 1500 meters were broken 8 times per decade from 1950s to 2000 but not at all since
* Sports has reached much of the global market and thus getting closer to reaching the limit of our source populations for bodies
