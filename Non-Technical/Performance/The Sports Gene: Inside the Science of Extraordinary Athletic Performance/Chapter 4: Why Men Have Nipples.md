# Chapter 4: Why Men Have Nipples

* Sprinter in the 1980s aws found to have a vagina and internal testes, breats but no ovaries or uterus, and male doess of testosterone that circulated intertly through her body
  * Most women can take advantage of the athletic benefits of the small amount of testosterone their body produces, but this sprinter could not
* Every human embryo is female for the first six weeks of existence
  * Because mammal fetuses are exposed to a hefty dose of female hormones from their mother, it is more economical to have the default sex be female
* In week six, the SRY gene cues the formation of testicles, and the Leydig cells that synthesize testosterone
* If you want to know whether the male or female of a given species is bigger and stronger, one piece of information is gnerally useful: which sex has the higher potential reproductive rate
  * Male gorillas generally have many mates, while a female gorilla can produce one offspring every four years
    * This means that male gorillas compete fiercely, and natural selection accentuates traits that make gorillas better fighters
    * For humans, there is a similar general pattern  where men who were most successful at intimidating other men used that success to mate with multiple women and have lots of children
* In competition zones that are more difficult to patrol and defend, like the sky, natural selection accentuates male traits such as attractive coloration and melodic courtship songs
* We have fewer male ancestors than female ancestors
  * Around 16 million Asian men have a nearly identical portion of the Y chromosome that geneticists think probably came from Genghis Khan
* It appears that the primary reason that women in track and field gained on men in the 1970s and 80s was due to doping
  * Since that era, women in the most explosive events have gotten worse
  * 75 of the top 80 women's world records in sprint and power events are from the 1970s
* Women with androgen insensitivity (they can use no testosterone at all) seem to be overrepresented in sports
  * The rate of androgen insensitivity is around 1/20k to 1/64k
  * Over five Olympic Games, 1/421 female competitors were determined to have androgen insensitivity
* Women with androgen insensitivity tend to have limb proportions more typical of men
  * They are also over-represented in modeling (tall with long legs)
  * Men have nippes because women do
    * Nipples are absolutely essential for reproductive success in women and they are not so harmful in men that these has been significant natural selection pressure to get rid of them
