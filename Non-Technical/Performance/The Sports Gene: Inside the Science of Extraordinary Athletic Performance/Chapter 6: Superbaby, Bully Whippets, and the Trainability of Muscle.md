# Chapter 6: Superbaby, Bully Whippets, and the Trainability of Muscle

* Belgian Blues (big cows) were missing DNA base pairs from the myostatin gene
* Myostatin is a "stop sign" for muscle growth
* "Superbaby" was a baby that lacked myostatin genes - no detectable myostatin in his blood
* Superbaby's mother had one typical myostatin gene and one mutation myostatin gene - she had less myostatin than the average person
  * Only adult with a documented myostatin mutation, was a professional sprinter
* Stem cells are outside muscle fibers
  * They wait until a muscle fiber becomes damaged (like from weight lifting) and then patch the muscle fiber
  * We do not gain new muscle fiber, but simply enlarge the ones we already have
* Strength training plan experiment
  * Subjects grew muscle by 50% (extreme responders), 25% or 0% (nonresponders)
  * The extreme responders had the most stem cells in their body already
  * Certain genes were turned up only for responders (genes involved in muscle function and growth)
