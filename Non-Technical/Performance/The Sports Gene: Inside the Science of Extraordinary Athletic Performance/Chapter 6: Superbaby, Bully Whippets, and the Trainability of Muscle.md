# Chapter 6: Superbaby, Bully Whippets, and the Trainability of Muscle

* Belgian Blues (big cows) were missing DNA base pairs from the myostatin gene
* Myostatin is a "stop sign" for muscle growth
* "Superbaby" was a baby that lacked myostatin genes - no detectable myostatin in his blood
* Superbaby's mother had one typical myostatin gene and one mutation myostatin gene - she had less myostatin than the average person
  * Only adult with a documented myostatin mutation, was a professional sprinter
* Stem cells are outside muscle fibers
  * They wait until a muscle fiber becomes damaged (like from weight lifting) and then patch the muscle fiber
  * We do not gain new muscle fiber, but simply enlarge the ones we already have
* Strength training plan experiment
  * Subjects grew muscle by 50% (extreme responders), 25% or 0% (nonresponders)
  * The extreme responders had the most stem cells in their body already
  * Certain genes were turned up only for responders (genes involved in muscle function and growth)
 
## Fast-twitch vs. slow-twitch

* Fast-twitch fibers are fibers for explosive movements
 * Grow twice as much as slow-twitch muscle fibers when exposed to weight training
* Sprinters' calf muscles are 75% or more fast-twitch muscle fibers
* Half-milers have 50/50 slow-twitch and fast-twitch
* Do successful athletes' muscle fiber composition occur due to training or because they're already built in a way that's aligned with their event
* No training study has been able to produce a substantial switch of slow-twitch to fast-twitch fibers
* Aerobic training can make fast-twitch fibers more endurant and strength training can make slow-twitch fibers stronger
* Many Danish soccer pros have fewer fast-twitch fibers than an average person
 * Researchers found that the swiftest talents are lost to chronic injuries
 * So they can't tolerate as much training as others
 * Less injury-prone players survive the development years, so the Danish elite level is skewed towards slow-twitch muscle types
