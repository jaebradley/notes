* Family members generally had similar aerobic benefits from training - variation _between_ different families was great
* About half of each person's ability to improve their aerobic capacity with training was determined exclusively by their parents

* The expression levels in 29 gene sets were unaltered by exercise, indicating that those genetic expression levels are not a result of prior training
