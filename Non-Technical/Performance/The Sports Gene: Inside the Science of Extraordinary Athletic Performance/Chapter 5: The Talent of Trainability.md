# Chapter 5: The Talent of Trainability

* Family members generally had similar aerobic benefits from training - variation _between_ different families was great
* About half of each person's ability to improve their aerobic capacity with training was determined exclusively by their parents
* Certain genes, present in all subjects, were more active in more trainable people than less trainable people
* The expression levels in 29 gene sets were unaltered by exercise, indicating that those genetic expression levels are not a result of prior training
* The probability that a person is both highly naturally gifted and highly trainable (i.e. elevated aerobic capacity and are high aerobic responders) is the product of two probabilities
  * ~1 in 100 and 1 in 1,000
* An athlete who stops training can lose more than 15% of their VO2 max in weeks
  * In the absence of training, the Olympian's aerobic capacity was on-par with the "naturally fit six" from the York University study
  * The "naturally fit six" being 6 out of 1,900 men that had way above average aerobic capacity
  * Olympian was able to recapture the 20% VO2 max capacity that they had lost when they were not training
