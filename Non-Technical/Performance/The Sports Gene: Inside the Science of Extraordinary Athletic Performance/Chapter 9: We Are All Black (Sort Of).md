# Chapter 9: We Are All Black (Sort Of)

* Eseentially every modern human outside of Africa can trace his or her ancestry to a single population that resided in sub-Saharan East Africa as recently as 90k years ago
* Our ancestors that ventured out from Africa might have consistend of just a few hundred people
  * This band of ancestors took only a fraction of humanity's genetic diversity with them
* The genetic diversity of native populations generally decreases the farther the population is among the human migratory from East Africa
* The most and least athletically gifted individuals in the world might be African as there's more genetic variation in Africa
* Mammals generally stop producing the lactase enzyme after the weaning period
  * Effectively true for all humans just 9k years ago
  * But the domestication of cows allowed any human who could digest lactose as an adult a reproductive advantage
  * Lactose tolerance is common in areas that relied on dairy farming (northern Europe) and lactose intolerance is common in areas where cattle domestication is more recent/nonexistent
