# [Why Do Domestic Prices Rise With Tarrffs?](https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2025/04/why-do-domestic-prices-rise-with-tarriffs.html)

* Example of expanding production of wine in Napa and Sonoma after adding adding import tax on French and Italian wine
* Expanding production without increasing costs is difficult
* To produce more, wine producers need more land
* But the most productive, cost-effective land for producing wine is already used
* So now, producers are using less productive land - land that might be more valuable for other purposes
  * Wine production competes with other economic activities like production of olive oil
* As wine production expands, costs increase because the opportunity costs of producing wine increases
* Expanding production displaces other high-value uses
* The increased cost reflects the opportunity cost
  * In this case, the value of goods that society forgoes to produce more wine (less olive oil)
* Trade is valuable because instead of producing more domestic wine, diverting resources from producing olive oil, we can produce more olive oil and trade some of it for foreign wine
* This trade is valuable when foreign producers have lower costs
* Tariffs do not increase domestic production, they shift domestic production from one industry to another
