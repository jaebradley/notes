## FROM CONNECTIVITY TO TECHNOFEUDALISM
* Observe winner-take-all effects, owing to connectivity
  * Only a few authors will prevail - either selling 20 million copies or unemployed
* Problems arise when the winners become sticky
  * Replacing Google (much like how it replaced competitors as it was growing) is much harder as Google's dominance has become entrenched
* Hyper-connectivity amplifies concentration
* Capitalism works by both allowing upward mobility and accelerating its downward equivalent

## DYNAMICS AND MISUNDERSTANDING OF HISTORICAL PROCESSES
* Ignoring GDP growth can lead to outsized errors due to compounding - when in doubt, use rate of growth as a measure of status quo
* Author compares and contrasts the growth in the Chinese economy from 6% of the global economy in 2007 to 20% in 2025
  * Conversely, the US and Europe both declined from 20% to 15%
* Author uses the example of Chinese and US military budgets to contrast the _value_ that both nations receive from these budgets
  * Author posits that Chinese goods can be produced cheaper than in the US (author uses examples of $1 chair produced in China and $53k garbage can produced in the US)
  * So even though the Chinese military budget is a third of the US military budget, because the Chinese can produce things cheaper
  * Because of this competitive production advantage there are second-order impacts on military budget
 
## THE S-CURVE AND ECONOMIC SATURATION
* Author posits that economies grow following an S-curve - that as they become more and more saturated, growth continues but sub-logarithmically (aka diminishing returns)
  * Once you have a two-car garage do you need a five-car garage?
* The Chinese economy is still growing while the European and US economies have reached saturation
  * Because European and US economies have reached saturation, there's less incentive to produce economic growth in these economies
  * Author contends that lifestyle improvements like pedestrian and cyclist-friendly citites may not produce economic growth
* It is the saturated economies that carry the most debt - and when you have a lot of debt, you need to grow in order to service that debt
* Tariffs stifle growth by forcing resources into lower-margin activities
  * Author's example of asking a brain surgeon to garden lawns to avoid being "ripped off" by professional gardeners
  * This negative growth impact is occurring when the (saturated) US economy needs growth the most
 
## IMMIGRATION
* > Immigration in small doses is socially benign; immigration in large doses threatens the museum-state perception of the locals as a discontinuity from past history and feels like an invasion, even if it is not.
* Author posits that the US and Europe have become structurally addicted to cheap immigrant labor like building oversized houses with large lawns and labor-intensive upkeep
* > The proportion of Muslims in Europe tends to be under 1/20, ranging between 1/10 and 1/100 in most countries — yet casual perceptions tend to be almost one order of magnitude higher.

## SCALE IS SIGNIFICANT
* Governance depends on scale
* > I’m a libertarian at the national level, a Republican at the state level, a Democrat at the municipal level, and a communist at the family level.
