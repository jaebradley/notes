# [Earners vs. Owners](https://medium.com/@profgalloway/earners-vs-owners-232fdd70be29)
* If you’re ever featured in a commercial calling you a “hero”, it mean’s you’re getting fucked
* The most fortunate in our society have no holiday, as they don’t need one
* Super-earners pay more than their fair share
  * A married household making more than $500k is in the top 5% of incomes and pays an effective federal income tax rate of ~25%
* Careers that pay that well require expensive degrees, long hours, and are typically in HCOL areas with high state income taxes
* Building wealth is like launching a rocket ship into orbit
  * Atmosphere = expenses, distance traveled = income
* Most never generate enough current income to make the jump to space and become an owner
* Entrepreneurs are barely visible to the Treasury standing behind the tax code
  * Section 1202 excludes the first $10 million received in the sale of a business
* When “Owners” die, this resets the basis of their assets, so heirs never pay taxes on the increase in value
* Buy, Borrow, Die: Owners take out loans secured by assets (company stock) and live off the loans, which are not considered taxable income (vs. selling, which would incur taxable gains)
  * When Owners die, the stock goes to their heirs, with the new basis, can sell enough stock tax-free to pay off the loans and start the cycle anew.
