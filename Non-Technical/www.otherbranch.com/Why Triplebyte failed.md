# [Why Triplebyte failed](https://www.otherbranch.com/blog/why-triplebyte-failed)

## We never solved candidate acquisition at scale

* Some companies want smart people who don’t have much of a resume, but most companies are not on this list
* Triplebyte was trying to convince sought-after engineers to use Triplebyte instead of their many alternatives, and Triplebyte never succeeded at doing this at scale
* Ad spend doesn’t scale well - each marginal ad spend dollar has greater and greater diminishing returns
* Product was viable at moderate scale ~$10M revenue per year

## The catch-22 of venture capital

* VC’s give money to pursue aggressive growth, and not to produce a successful, but small / middle-sized company
* If you needed VC money to produce a viable small-scale business, you didn’t really have a viable small-scale business to begin with
* For Triplebyte, they needed VC to create a viable company, but that viable company did not satisfy investors’ growth targets

## We pivoted to a product no one wanted

* Triplebyte pivoted to “LinkedIn for Engineers”
* To disrupt an incumbent, you need to be a step function better
* The core value proposition of LinkedIn isn’t “we make finding a job easy and pleasant”, it’s “we have all the jobs and all the candidates” - hard to be a step function better as a growth-stage Series B company with a nine-figure valuation
* No one wanterd another LinkedIn because LinkedIn had perfected its value-prop
* For the remainder of Triplebyte’s lifetime, platform activity was dominated by the candidates that were early adopters of the “FastTrack” product, which was an engineering quiz

## Our bet on Screen didn't work

* Triplebyte’s assessments but for company’s own use
* Triplebyte would keep the assessment scores, and use these for candidate acquisition later
* Candidates that companies sent through the automated screening process were the candidates those companies considered plentiful and of dubious quality (inbound applicants, like junior candidates, or international candidates)
* Screen didn’t align with goal of acquiring valuable candidates
* Screen’s candidates groups were mutually exclusive with the US-based senior candidates that clients were buying Triplebyte subscriptions for
* They didn’t build a valuable database
* Main usage metric for screen looked good
* Had to look many metric layers deep to see issues around the business goals
* Screen was a product that succeeded at the product level (users liked it, it delivered values) but it did not accomplish its business goals because it fundamentally did not work for the kind of growth that was necessary

## We tried to change our users

* Changing user behavior is fundamentally harder than giving people what they want
* Triplebyte started with the premise of “what is the right way to do this in the abstract” and worked backwards to convince users to try it
