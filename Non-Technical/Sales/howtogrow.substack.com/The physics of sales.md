# [The physics of sales](https://howtogrow.substack.com/p/the-physics-of-sales)
* Seller-push theory of sales: seller convincing buyer to buy
  * Incorrect because people rarely say "you've convinced me - let me drop all of my priorities and projects to buy your product"
* Reality more closely resembles buyer-pull theory: the primary force that closes a deal is a buyer trying to accomplish a project on their to-do list
* Idea of creating urgency is a seller-push approach as urgency is found on their to-do list, not created by the seller
* A "deep-dive demo" is designed around pushing product benefits vs. designing the demo to solve what the customer needs
* If you are building more product in order to be able to sell rather than building a product as a response to sales, it's probably because you think your job is to push a product onto potential customers that is so feature-complete it overcomes all other potential objections (which it won't)
