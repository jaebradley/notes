# [Does Marriage Even Make Sense Anymore](https://medium.com/personal-growth/does-marriage-even-make-sense-anymore-70e10f4d8c18)

* Marriage made sense...when women were effectively private property and didn't have access to the workplace while men had income but needed heirs
* It's harder to leave if everyone you know identifies you as being part of a married couple
* People marry to show their family and friends how well their lives are going even if deep down they are unsure whether their partnership will last a lifetime
* In short, we want to marry so we can hold onto another - "I don't want to be alone"
* Contracts can be broken, so they're a false sense of security - we don't control other people
* Security becomes comfort and comfort makes us lazy - relationships take work and getting lazy is a huge driver
* I'd rather leave the door wide open for my partner than hold him legally obligated to stay - I want to know they're their because they want to be...and I want to work for that
* A toaster, a firm, a university, a horse, and a senator are all just fine and dandy, but when they become our toaster, firm, university, horse, and senator they are instantly finer and dandier
* It's not about having married "The One" but having married
* If you value social acceptance (especially among family and friends, but also professional and/or religious groups), then just get married. And do whatever it takes to stay married.
* Deeper happiness means we understand that the only thing we control is ourselves. And that everything changes, and sometimes people change, and contracts mean very little to the human spirit at the end of it all
  * It means people are not "parts" to "complete the picture" of a "perfect" life
* Focus on what we can control (which is ourselves)
* Committing to our partner - love them healthily and hard, every day
