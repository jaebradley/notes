# [35 Things You Need to Give Up to Be Successful](https://journal.thriveglobal.com/35-things-you-need-to-give-up-to-be-successful-c07c326aec31)

1. Wasting Five Minutes
  * If we have 5 five-minute breaks per day => 25 minutes daily => 9,125 minutes yearly
2. Not Valuing One Dollar
  * Understanding the value of one dollar is the same as coming to appreciate the value of time
  * It also reflects a lack of care about the details, which is where the true art and value lies
3. Believing Success Will Make You Happy
  * `We buy things to make us happy, and we succeed. But only for a while. New things are exciting to us at first, but then we adapt to them`
  * Until you appreciate what you currently have, more won't make your life better
4. Believing You're Not Up For The Challenge
  * The longer you procrastinate or avoid doing something, the more painful (in your head) it becomes. However, once you take action, the discomfort is far less sever than you imagined. Event to extremely difficult things, humans adapt.
5. Pursuing "Happiness"
  * People's thought process:
    * Have something (time, money, etc)
    * ...In order to do something (travel, write, start a business)
    * ...In order to be something (happy, peaceful, content, or motivated)
  * But in reality, this `have` - `do` - `be` idea must be reversed.
  * You attract what you are.
6. Undervaluing What You Have
  * If you appreciate what you already have, then more will be a good thing in your life.
  * If you feel the need to have more to compensate for something missing in your life, you'll always be left wanting...
7. Downplaying Your Current Position
  * The world owes you nothing - life isn't meant to be fair.
9. Competing With Other People
  * Competing with others leads to spending every day pursuing goals that aren't one's own - but rather goals that society deems important.
10. Trying To Have It All
  * We all need to choose what matters most to us, and own that. If we attempt to be everything, we'll end up being nothing.
11. Forgetting Where You Came From
  * It's easy to see yourself as superior to other people.
  * Humility, gratitude, and recognition of your blessings keep your success in proper prospective.
  * You couldn't do what you've done without the help of countless other people.
12. Seeking Permission From Others
  * Real estate investor that tells people that they shouldn't do it
    * Those who are going to succeed will do so regardless of what I say
13. Letting Others Determine How Much Money You Can Earn
  * Most people say they want to be successful, but if they really wanted to, they'd be successful.
14. Ignoring the Vision You Have For Your Future
  * What you plant you must harvest - so plant with intention.
  * The blueprint you design in your head becomes the life you build.
17. Continuing to be Distracted
  * Almost everything is a distraction from what really matters
18. Realizing That Focus is Today's I.Q.
  * We waste hours every day staring idly at a screen
  * Our attention spans have shrunk to almost nothing and our willpower has atrophied.
  * The ability to perform deep work is becoming increasingly rare at exactly the same time it is becoming increasingly valuable.
22. Creating What You Think You "Should" Create
  * Your work should first and foremost resonate with yourself
23. Looking For The Next Opportunity
  * The grass is greener where you water it.
  * Don't wish it was easier, wish you were better. Don't wish for less problems, wish for more skills. Don't wish for less challenge, wish for more wisdom.
24. Waiting To Start
  * If you don't purposefully carve time out every day to progress and improve - your time will get lost.
26. Playing By The "Rules"
  * Failure is something to be prized and praised.
  * Failure is feedback and moving forward. It's conscious effort toward something you've never done before.
27. Setting Yourself Up To Win
  * Start from the end and work backwards.
  * Instead of thinking about what is plausible or expected, start with what you want.
  * Then dictate daily / weekly / monthly / yearly behaviors to facilitate that.
29. Viewing Your Work as "Work"
  * Your work will be better received if you see it as an art-form - they want you just as much as they want your work.
32. Downplaying The Importance Of Yesterday
  * The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second best time is now.
  * Today is tomorrow's yesterday - most people put things off until tomorrow.
33. Believing You're Way Behind
  * When you're winning big, it's easy to get lax and overconfident - when you're losing big, it's easy to give up.
