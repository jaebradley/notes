* Sarcasm, annoyance, irritation, skepticism, criticism, jealousy, selfishness and distance are all anger too
* you may even *pride* yourself on your anger (or "sarcasm", or "criticalness", or "logic", or how everyone else is mediocre, at best)
* All the things that don't work for effective emotional management
  * **Bury it**: Shove it into a tiny box deep inside yourself and deny its very existence until the end of time. Deny ever having the emotion; deny even understanding what the emotion is.
  * **Express it**: Act out in whatever way seems fitting, and if you aren't sure, err on the side of "more".
  * **Fix it**: Preferably, by seeing a therapist who will guide you through how you're "flawed", "bad", or "wrong". Talk about your anger, but then focus more on the causes - who, what, where, when, and of course, why - effectively framing yourself as a victim who needs to be "helped"
* The language for "fixing" implies that we are "bad", "damaged", or "victims" - it does more to cement our self-loathing than it does to fix the problem
* When anger happens, acknowledge it - do so without giving in to it (expressing it or lashing out) or judging it (or yourself)
  * when you honor your emotions, but do so without throwing yourself at their feet and lashing out, you also honor yourself
* Anger is always caused by unmet needs - and the need is never "to be angry"
  * Feeling "hangry" doesn't mean we're actually angry with whatever we've channeled negative emotions at - we're just hungry. The solution is not to ignore it, or express anger - it's to eat.
* Don't be so "compassionate" that you end up being codependent
