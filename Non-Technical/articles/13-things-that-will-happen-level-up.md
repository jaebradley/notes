# [13 Things That Will Happen When You "Level Up" As A Person](https://medium.com/@benjaminhardy/how-to-know-if-youve-leveled-up-as-a-person-3ff0611e16fc)

* > I was seized upon by my 'Other self' which had zero fear, was completely clear, and operated with definiteness of purpose.
* > I think the ability of the average man could be doubled if it were demanded, if the situation demanded
* You haven’t rose as high as you’re about to because you’ve never been demanded as much as you are now
* You're as sick as your secrets
* But be even more vulnerable and honest now with your “inner circle.” You need them now more than ever. This doesn’t mean you won’t feel alone. You absolutely will feel alone. But just like the lack of confidence, this feeling will shortly go away. You’re growing and be purged.
* What used to keep you awake at night with excitement now finds you sleeping-in in attempts to avoid.
* You’ll have so much momentum that muscle memory will take over. But your heart won’t be in it for a short-time.
  * You’ll still succeed. But it won’t matter to you, because you didn’t push yourself.
  * Not in alignment with your why
* > “A ‘once-in-a-lifetime opportunity’ is irrelevant if it is the wrong opportunity.”
* The only opportunities that matter are the one’s that deeply resonate. Stay close to people you know deep down really care.
* Un-commit to several “opportunities” that were nothing more than appealing distractions
* You’ll need to get back to your core. You’ll need to get back to the drawing board.
* A mind that is stretched by a new experience can never go back to its old dimensions.
