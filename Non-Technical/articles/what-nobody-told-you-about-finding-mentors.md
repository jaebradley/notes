* > “We need to stop telling them, ‘Get a mentor and you will excel,’ Instead we need to tell them, ‘Excel and you will get a mentor.’”
* If you email a total stranger to ask them to commit to give you hours of their time over a period of years and demand that this gift is to be called a “mentorship,” you’re going to be disappointed.
  * At the same time, what's the worst that can happen? You come across as eager to learn?
* Don’t pick [insert famous, incredibly wealthy, genius person] and swing for the fences. Because you will strike out and it will hurt. Work your way up.
* Very rarely does anyone else help anyone else out for genuinely altruistic reasons.
  * So think about how you can help them out, and let that define how you act and think.
  * Having a whiz kid or a protege around is good for business, that’s why they’re doing it.
* If you don’t know what your chosen field is, you’re not ready [for a mentor].
* You have to know who the leaders and innovators and talented people in your chosen field are - otherwise you're not ready for mentorship
* Never, and I repeat never, act like they’re obligated to do anything; because they’re not.
