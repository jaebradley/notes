# [The Deathbed Fallacy](https://medium.com/@rikardhjort/the-deathbed-fallacy-5e54d9639167)

* The fallacy is to assume that whoever you are on your deathbed knows how you should live your life right now.
* You should consider yourself over a lifetime not as a single person, but a line of many people with different views and priorities.
* The deathbed is not a representative state of life, and what you want when you are there might not have much correlation with what would have been the happiest, most satisfactory and/or meaningful life you could have led.
* But that is just present me shaming past me for dragging himself through an ordeal which benefitted us both.
* I want to learn a shit lot, I want good jobs, I want money, I want to influence. Deathbed-me would probably scowl and think I’ve gotten my priorities all twisted up. But I am doing this for us.
* I believe that hard work can take me places I will enjoy more than where I’d end up if I just focused on being happy in the moment, following the Deathbed List.
