# [Do These Things After 6PM](https://medium.com/the-mission/do-these-things-after-6-p-m-and-your-life-will-never-be-the-same-1dcc545664dc)

* How you spend the hours before you go to bed reflects the value you place on the most important things in life.
* But the daily grind can easily overshadow your passion project like writing a book, learning a new language, starting an online business, creating art, learning an instrument, designing, learning to code, collecting and selling vintage objects etc.
* It’s not enough to show up to work on time, and do a good job.
* You have to remain relevant and consistently improve to become a better version of yourself.
* Devote just 60 minutes of your time after work to the best opportunity in your life.
* Your single most important task within that time is to make even the smallest progress on your passion project.
* > Very few people get anything like their potential horsepower translated into the actual horsepower of their output in life. Potential exceeds realization for many people.
* Don’t settle on a self-imposed plateau; always aim a bit higher than before.
* It’s not about the kind of skills you acquire because you have to, but because you want to and it feels right.
* Something you are happy to do without hesitation.
* When you put yourself on the line or otherwise expose yourself to the possibility of failure.
* > Reading is to the mind what exercise is to the body.
