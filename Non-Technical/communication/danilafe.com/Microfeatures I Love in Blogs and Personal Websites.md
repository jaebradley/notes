# [Microfeatures I Love in Blogs and Personal Websites](https://danilafe.com/blog/blog_microfeatures/)

## Sidenotes

* Notes on the “sides” of the main content body, centered in the middle of the page
* Can provide citations “in flow” of the main material without having to navigate to the bottom of the page and return to the top of the page

## Table of Contents

* Show what the post is about, in the form of headings
* Navigate interesting part of the page without having to scroll

## Showing Page Progress

* Header bar that fills from left to right as the article is scrolled
* While the browser scroll bar *could* show this behavior, any type of comment section or footer material could make the page size deceptively long
* Can combine this with a Table of Contents to build a dynamic table of contents that shows where in the post a reader is based on the “active” heading

## Easily Linkable Headings

* Use the `id` of a particular HTML element
* Show link after content or hyperlink header

## Dialogues

* Content that has an educational back-and-forth between an instructor and a student (or any two “voices”)

## Code Blocks with Origin

* Code block with a right side panel that describes in plain English what is happening from a code perspective

## Different Markers for Different Destinations

* Wikipedia link icon vs. regular external link icon vs. `.org` URL

## Link Preview

* Overlay with link popup
