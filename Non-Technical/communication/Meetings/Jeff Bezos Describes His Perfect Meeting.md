# [Jeff Bezos Describes His Perfect Meeting](https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/jeff-bezos-meeting-agenda-no-slideshows-two-pizza-rule/467145)

* Crisp document - messy meeting
* Powerpoints are easy to create, but hard for the audience to get closer to the truth
  * Can hide sloppy thinking in bullet points
* Memos require much more time and effort from the author (could take weeks to write a proper 6 page memo)
* "An example of a really bad way of coming to an agreement is compromise" (vs. getting to the "truth")
* Two pizza rule - if two pizzas isn't enough to feed the whole group, there are too many people in the meeting
