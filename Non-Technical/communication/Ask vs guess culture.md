# [Ask vs guess culture](https://jean.medium.com/ask-vs-guess-culture-adcf88313211)

## Ask culture expectations

* Ask for what you want (even if it seems out of reach or like an unreasonable request)
* Take care of your own needs, and others will take care of theirs
* It's fine to make requests that people will probably say no to
* People say yes to requests that they truly feel good about, and say no to requests that they don't feel good about

## Guess culture expectations

* Only ask for something if you're already pretty sure the other person will say yes
* Read contextual cues to determine if your request is reasonable to make
* Rude to put person in a position where they have to say no
* If the appropriate feelers and context are set, you will never have to make your request at all

## Examples

* Ask culture is posting on Facebook asking help with moving, directly reaching out to friends
* Guess culture is not asking friends to help moving if they mention that their friends are in town
  *  Friend asks you if you want to borrow their truck, but you decline saying you don't want to inconvenience them, but when they offer again, you accept
 
## Cultural Differences

* Asian culture: expectations around values and behavior were communicated through indirect messaging
  * Author's example of driving to visit a relative against the explicit wishes of relatives
  * Afterwards, relatives thanked them for the drive
  * Guess culture is a lot of saying not really what you actually want, and a lot of reading between the lines to figure out what people want
  * When a preference is declared, the response will most likely be a "compromised" version of what they really want, taking preferences into account, existing resources, etc.
  * May be better off listing options and gauging their response to each one
* Western society is ask culture
  * Individualism / asking for what you want will benefit you

## At Work

* Western corporate work is almost entirely ask culture
* Being guess-culture in an ask-culture work environment looks like hoping someone will tap you to become a manager because you're clearly the best person for the job
* Get more comfortable with people saying no to you
  * If people are not saying no to you, you're probably still only asking for things that you already know people will say yes to
* Ask yourself "if I could have my way" to hone in on exactly what you want
