# [Ask vs guess culture](https://jean.medium.com/ask-vs-guess-culture-adcf88313211)

## Ask culture expectations

* Ask for what you want (even if it seems out of reach or like an unreasonable request)
* Take care of your own needs, and others will take care of theirs
* It's fine to make requests that people will probably say no to
* People say yes to requests that they truly feel good about, and say no to requests that they don't feel good about

## Guess culture expectations

* Only ask for something if you're already pretty sure the other person will say yes
* Read contextual cues to determine if your request is reasonable to make
* Rude to put person in a position where they have to say no
* If the appropriate feelers and context are set, you will never have to make your request at all

## Examples

* Ask culture is posting on Facebook asking help with moving, directly reaching out friends
