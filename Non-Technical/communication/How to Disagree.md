# [How to Disagree](https://paulgraham.com/disagree.html)

## Name-calling

* It's important to recognize that more articulate name-calling has just as little weight
  * "The author is a self-important dilettante" is just a pretentious name calling

## Ad Hominem

* Example is if a senator wrote an article saying that senators' salaries should be increased
* Ad hominem attack is "of course he would say that, he's a senator"
* If there's something wrong with the senator's argument, you should say what it is
* If there isn't something wrong with the senator's argument, what difference does it make that he's a senator?
* Saying that an author lacks the authority to write about a topic is a varient of ad hominem

## Responding to Tone

* Responses to the writing, rather than the writer
* It matters much more whether the author is wrong or right than what his tone is

## Contradiction

* Start of responses to what was said, rather than how or by whom
* Lowest form of response is simply to state the opposing case, with little or no supporting evidence
* Sometimes merely seeing the opposing case stated explicitly is enough to see that it's right

## Counterargument

* More often than not, two people arguing passionately about something are actually arguing about two different things

## Refutation

* Usually involves quoting the opposing source
* If you can't find an actual quote to disagree with, you may be arguing with a straw man

## Refuting the Central Point

* Deliberate dishonesty is when someone picks out minor points of an argument and refutes them
* Correcting someone's grammar / harping on minor mistakes are usually done for the purpose of discrediting one's opponent
* An effective refutation looks like
  * "Author's main point is X. As he says... But this is wrong for the following reasons..."
