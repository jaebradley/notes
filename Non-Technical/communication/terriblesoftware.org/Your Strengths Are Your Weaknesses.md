# [Your Strengths Are Your Weaknesses](https://terriblesoftware.org/2025/03/31/your-strengths-are-your-weaknesses/)

* Biggest strengths and most frustrating weaknesses are often the exact same trait showing up in different contexts
* In other words: the qualities we celebrate in our team members are usually the same ones causing our biggest headaches
* Most poeople see their strenths and weaknesses as separate things - they're not
  * "Your ability to dive deep into problems is why you find solutions nobody else can. It's also why you sometimes miss deadlines. Same trait, different outcomes."
* Don't make people guess when their natural tendencies hurt vs. help
  * In author's example, engineer is collaborative, never making a decision without external input
    * Valuable for larger discussions, but not for everyday decisions
* Tension is a feature, not a bug
  * Some managers try to build teams where everyone works the same way
  * The goal isn't to create "balanced" engineers with no pronounced strengths or weaknesses
  * Goal of managing is not to sand down people's edges until everybody is the same shape
