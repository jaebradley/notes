## Your culture shapes who you become

* Highly-competent people spend their days around highly competent people
* Instinct to curate a culture (i.e. increasing skill level of peer group) - the primary goal was not to explicitly teach

## No, it is your milieu that shapes you

* milieu is the culture contained in your unique set of connections
* Unlike anthropoligical culture, a milieu is not (as) monolithic and can shift
* Determined by choice of friends, careers, algorithms that feed us content

## A milieu is a directed graph

* Nodes = people / books / content and edges = ideas
* Directed because you have nodes that send you input and you send certain nodes output
* "agency" is the view of this graph - you _are_ the graph and can change the graph and thus yourself

## Curating your input

* Example of a guitarist, John Frusciante, that was deliberate of curating his milieu
* He knew how othher guitarists' playing styles interrelate and where he wants to position himself in that playing landscape
* He has "a map" (network) of guitarists that is organized by technique and by the effect that they have on him
