# [What I think about when I edit](https://evaparish.com/blog/how-i-edit)

## Demonstrative pronouns

* Instead of saying `this` or `that`, add a noun to spell out exactly what you're referring to, even if you've just mentioned it

#### Before
>We only have two boxes left. To solve this, we should order more.

#### After
>We only have two boxes left. To solve *this shortage*, we should order more

#### Before
>Click next and enter your credentials when prompted. That will take you to the home screen.

#### After
>Click next and enter your credentials when prompted. *Successfully authenticating* will take you to the home screen.

## Simplify

* Shorten constructions, extraneous words
* Strive to get to the point as quickly as possible

## Replace "You should" / "You can"

* When writing instructions, replace `You should/can X` with the imperative mood of the verb

#### Before
>You should save the file to your home directory

#### After
>Save the file to your home directory

## Rewrite "of" and "for" constructions

#### Before
>The manager of the team responsible for marketing

#### After
>The marketing team's manager

## Eliminate passive voice

* Passive voice obscures who or what is performing the action

#### Before
>The fire alarm was pulled and building was evacuated.

#### After
>The fire marshal pulled the alarm and the employees evacuated the building.

#### Before
>Millions of dollars were embezzled from the company.

#### After
>Two executives embezzled millions of dollars from the company.

* In technical documentation, you lose precision when you don't attribute the action to someone or something

## Don't use adverbs

* "He laughed loudly" relies on the reader to somehow intuit the precise volume of laughter
* Whereas "He laughed with the kind of booming abandon that made the whole restaurant turn around and look" conveys the level of laughter much more precisely
* People use adverbs as a hedge - "essentially, this is what I'm saying"
  * Remove the adverb and commit to saying whatever you're saying

## Don't assume knowledge

* Spell out acryonyms on first use
* Add a phrase or a sentence briefly explaning the concept when you introduce it.

>TTFB measures how long it takes...
