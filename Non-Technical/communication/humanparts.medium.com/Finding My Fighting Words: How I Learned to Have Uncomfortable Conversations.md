* EQ ("emotional quotient") measures the ability to understand other people (to listen, to empathize, to self-regulate, to appreciate)
* Author noticed another property that certain colleagues had that enabled them to achieve positions of credibility and authority
  * This trait seemed to be anti-EQ - to say things that others did not want to hear
  * Assertiveness
* Author contends that having "AQ" boils down to the ability to have uncomfortable conversations
* High AQ + High EQ: Respected Leaders
* High AQ + Low EQ: Assholes
* Low AQ + High EQ: People Pleasers
* Low AQ + Low EQ: Grumblers

## Practicing AQ

* Exercises were focussed on uncomfortable negotiation and unusual conversation
* For example, negotiate at flea markets where author would offer vendors unreasonably low prices for their wares
  * Made offer, remained silent, maintaining eye contact until they replied
  * If they declined, author had to repeat offer, followed by silent stare
  * If they declined again, author thanked them and went on their way
* Unsual conversations involved approaching strangers and saying / doing things that were downright weird
  * "Do you like my shoes?", "do you have a stick of gum?", etc

## Retrospective

* Author was surprised by how violently their brain and body would revolt when put in these uncomfortable social situations
  * Felt mentally and physically drained
* Author now has more awareness with how their brain and body react when engaging in socially uncomfortable situations
  * Previously, these situations would trigger an automatic flight response
* Author also noticed that strangers responded to weird requests cautiously but politely
  * Noted that their projections for how people will react are often much worse than their reactions actually are
