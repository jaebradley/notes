# Chapter 11. Presenting with Charisma

* Speeches that give us a feeling of awe and wonder are those that appeal to our childhood roots
* If you’re mentioning the fact that there is untapped potential in your customer base, liken yourselves to “bounty hunters” or “treasure hunters” searching for “hidden gold”
* Make numbers and statistics personal - “this memory card has 12 GBs of memory which means that it holds enough music for you to travel to the moon and back”
* Remember to make the content so simple that even a multitasking, partially listening audience member would get it
* Good practice to audio record or visually record speech to identify “irritants” - sounds or movements that do not add to the message
* Another way to make people feel special as you roam about the stage is to give one or two seconds of eye contact per person
* Add note to breathe at top of page, and include “Pause. Breathe. Slow Down” every few pages
* Add colored bars for certain duration pauses: blue bar = one-beat pause, two red bars for two-beat pause
* Even make notes for particular parts that need warmth / smile
