* If impatience is the issue, delve into the minute physical sensations you're feeling to regain presence)
* Good listeners know never, ever to interrupt
  * Not even if the impulse to do so comes from excitement about what the other person just said
  * Will always result in their feeling at least a twinge of resentment or frustration at not having been allowed to complete their setence
* When someone interrupts you, let them
  * If you notice another person getting ready to speak keep your sentences short, and leave frequent pauses for them to jump in
* Pause before you answer
  * Let your face absorb the statement
  * Let your face react to the statement
  * Then, answer

## Take a Compliment

* Stop
* Absorb the compliment
* Let the absorption show on your face
* Thank them
* Let people impress you - imagine that they are the main star in a move you're watching

## Avoid White Elephants

* Avoid phrases with "problem", "worry", "heistate"
* Instead use phrases like "We'll take care of it", "Please feel free to call anytime"

## Vocal Warmth

* Just thinking about smiling is enough to give your voice more warmth
* Visualize being a preacher with a rich, rolling, resonant voice, in front of their congregation
