# Chapter 7. Charismatic First Impressions

## Break the Ice

* Use open-ended questions - "what's the story behind it?"
* "Story" has a very strong emotional effect - it sends people straight into storytelling mode
* Simply inserting "you know" before any sentence makes people perk up

## Graceful Exits

* Offer value (information, connection, visibility, recognition) to foster feeling of warmth and goodwill
  * Departure from conversation will have halo of generosity
* "You know, based on what you've said, you should check out X. If you have a card, I'll send you a link."
* If breaking up the group, focus all warmth not on the person you're taking, but the person being left behind
  * "I'm sorry, but I need X - will you let me bring him over there?"
    * Nominal feeling of having choice in the matter
