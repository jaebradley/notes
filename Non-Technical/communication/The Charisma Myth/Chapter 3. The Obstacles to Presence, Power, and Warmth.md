# Chapter 3. The Obstacles to Presence, Power, and Warmth

* When you're choosing a location for a meeting, take comfort into consideration
  * What will the temperature and noise level be like?
  * Ensure that you'll be well fed; don't let yourself or your guests get too hungry
  * Think about your energy level, and the energy level of the people whom you'll be interacting
* Be sure to choose clothing that will make you neither too hot nor too cold
  * Avoid clothing that is itchy, ill fitting, or in any way distracting
  * Any physical distraction will use up part of your mental focus and impair your performance
  * Ensure your clothing is loose enough for you to breathe well and fully

## Anxiety Caused by Uncertainty

* Our inability to tolerate uncertainty carries multiple costs
* Causes us to make premature decisions
* Hampers negotiations, leading us to reveal more than we should as we scramble to fill the silence, unable to bear the uncertainty of not knowing what the other person is thinking
* Can lead us to feel anxious, impacting charisma
* Once you've thought through each scenario, the rational, reasonable, logical thing to do would be to put the situation out of your mind and go about your day until action is actually required
* In uncertain situations, what we really want to know is that things are somehow going to work out fine
* If we could be certain that things will work out, the uncertainty would produce much less anxiety

## Responsibility Transfer Exercise

* Pick a benevolent entity
* Imagine lifting the weight of everything you're concerned about off your shoulders and placing it on the shoulders of whichever entity you've chosen
* Visually lift everything off your shoulders and feel the difference as you are no longer responsible for the outcome of any of these things

## Dissatisfaction Caused by Comparison

* The very act of comparing and evaluating hinders our ability to be fully present
* Trying to optimize both impairs our presence and creates anxiety due to the pressure of finding the best possible choice
