# Chapter 10. Difficult Situations

* The Ben Franklin Effect: ask an opponent for a favor
  * "I did something nice for this person so I must like him. I wouldn't have agreed to do a favor for someone I dislike"
* Better yet, ask them for their opinion, which might feel less burdensome than a favor
* Show somebody the impact they've had on a project or an idea
  * They'll feel a degree of ownership and may even feel driven to support it
* Hostility is often nothing but the external manifestation of inner turmoil
* Kindness charisma can be an effective tool in dealing with difficult people
* Telling somebody they shouldn't feel "insulted" falls into the "white elephant" trap of ending up focusing on (and remembering) the word "insulted"
* Think of a person whom you deeply respect before delivering criticism
  * Grandparent, mentor, spiritual figure - how would you word your criticism in front of them
* When closing difficult conversations
  * Review next steps, give sense of constructive forward motion
  * Praise even the slightest good effort, providing positive reinforcement
  * Bring up anything to look forward to in the future, whatever conveys the fact you're looking forward to future interactions
* When you're apologizing, your first concern is to let the other person have their say - to listen
  * You'll know you've listened enough when they say, "Am I talking too much?"
* Being present on the phone is at least as important as it is in person
  * It may be easier to project presence in person because of the many different way to communicate
  * By phone, the non-verbal communication is limited
* Go through marketing materials or emails using two differently-colored highlighters
  * One color is used to highlight things that relate to a given subject (in the author's example it was marketing materials for a large firm, so language that would relate to these firms)
  * Another color to highlight language relating to potential clients
  * The language relating to clients should dominate the language relating to the firm
* For emails: perfection is not when there is no more to add, but when there is no more to subtract
