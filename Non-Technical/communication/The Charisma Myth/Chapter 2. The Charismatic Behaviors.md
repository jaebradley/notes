# Chapter 2. The Charismatic Behaviors

* Presence, power, and warmth
* Bring yourself back into the present moment as often as you can by focusing on your breath, or your toes, for just a second
  * Use this to get back to focusing on the other person
* Most moments, we have a continuous internal commentary on what is happening and what we should do next
  * Deep moments of social interactions become blurred by our computations about how to long hug, what we're going to say when we're done
* Warmth is assesed almost entirely through body language and behavior - it's evaluated more directly than power
* Someone who is powerful but not warm can be impressive, but isn't necessarily perceived as charismatic
  * They can come across as arrogant, cold, standoffish
* Someone who possesses warmth without power can be likable, but isn't necessarily perceived as charismatic
  * Can come across as overeager, subservient, desperate to please
* Your brain cannot distinguish imagination from reality
  * Imaginary situations cause your brain to send your body the same commands as it would for a real situation
* Nocebo effect is when the mind creates toxic consequences in the body in reaction to completely fictional causes
  * Example experiment: people who knew they were allergic to poison ivy were rubbed with a harmless leaf, but told they'd been exposed to poison ivy
  * Every person developed a rash where they'd been rubbed
