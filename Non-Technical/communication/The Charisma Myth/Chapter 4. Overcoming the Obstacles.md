# Chapter 4. Overcoming the Obstacles

* Someone's coldness or reservation might be a side effect of an "internal tempest" and there's a good chance that it has nothing to do with how they feel about you or what you've just said
* Not all reactions are due to something that was said - it could be how they're feeling about themselves, or even an itchy wool suit
* When your brain spins negative scenarios, remind yourself that you may not be getting an accurate perception of reality
  * Your brain might be following its negativity bias, playing up some elements more than others, or omitting some positives entirely
* If you notice an unpleasant thought, see it as graffiti on a wall - not a verdict on what kind of person you are
* Failure is seldom fatal, and just realizing that even the worst-case scenario is survivable can bolster your confidence
* Depersonalize the experience - instead of saying, "I'm feeling ashamed", try "There is shame being felt"
  * Imagine that you're a scientist observing a phenomenon
* What if this unfortunate, unpleasant experience is absolutely perfect just as it is - in what way can this turn out to be absolutely perfect for me?
* Deception may not be necessary for the placebo effect to take hold; it may work wonders even when people know full well that they're taking a placebo
* The act of committing things to writing has been shown to be critical both in changing a person's mind and in making imagined stories feel more real
  * Write in the present tense, or even better in the past tense ("The speech is going well" -> "The speech went well")
* "Resentment is like drinking poison and waiting for the other person to die"
* Rather than suppress the sensations of discomfort, goal is to give them your full attention
  * Focussing on the minute sensations of your physical discomfort gives your mind something concrete to focus on other than its growing conviction that this situation is unbearable
  * Also brings you fully present into the current moment
  * Describe each one as if you were a chef describing a specialty dish
