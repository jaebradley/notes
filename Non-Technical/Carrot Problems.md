## Background Story

* British invested radar that allowed it to shoot down pilots at night
* They didn't want the Germans to know about the technology, so they invented a propaganda campaign that claimed their pilots had developed exceptional eyesight by eating a lot of carrots
* Carrot problem - any time someone achieves success in a way that they don't want to publicly admit, they have to come up with an excuse for their abilities
  * Means misleading people into wasting their time

## Example

* Steroid users / performance enhancing drugs users don't want to admit taking steroids so they come up with other reasons for their increased performance
  * Anybody following "advice" will end up disappointed as without steroids they won't be able to get the same results
* Companies distribute jobs to friends and insiders but don't want to admit that publicly
  * So they create a public job application process, causing outsiders to waste time and effort applying through a channel that has a 0% chance at landing them a job

## Side-effects

* Certain narratives cause to outsiders who believe that you can succeed by doing [X/Y/Z], because famous VC/startup influencers kept saying so, and they believed it
