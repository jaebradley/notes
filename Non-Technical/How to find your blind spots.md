* Success is a noisy and laggy indicator
  * Possible to play a good game of chess and lose (and play a bad game of chess and win)
* Experts find shorter feedback cycles by breaking the larger skill down into "minigames"
  * "Do I have the right shapes for the items in this sketch scene?"
  * Most people think that the path to improvement lies solely in building upon minigames they know
  * Junior engineers get first job by solving Leetcode problems, so they seek to reach the next level by trying to learn how to solve Leetcode problems faster
    * vs. closing foundational gaps they see between themselves and more effective senior engineers
    * Leetcode may have gotten you the job, but it won't help make more of an impact in the role
* Good coaches can provide advice on which minigames to focus on
* Being an expert in a field does not make you a good coach in that field
