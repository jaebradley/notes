# [Diary of a Brand: Hoka](https://medium.com/embedded-brand-strategy/diary-of-a-brand-hoka-one-one-68f18b3415d2)

## Brand Growth Model

* Two phases of brand-building: definition and scaling
* Definition is about distinctiveness i.e. solving a problem for a specific niche
* Scaling is about expanding from that niche
  * New customers, new use cases, etc
  * Keeping distinctive elements that serves as a brand moat

## Initial traction via influencers

* Hoka approached ultra-runner Karl Meltzer
  * "People thought they looked like clown shoes, but I didn't care...I could float over rocks and not feel anything"
* Meltzer's performance improved, and combination of unique look and product performance helped Hoka gain notice among the ultra-running community

## Scaling

* Hoka was a differentiated product in that it represented a technological breakthrough
* Brands that have experienced explosive growth have had some type of "visually arresting" quality about them

## 3 levers of Hoka expansion

### Product Range

* Lower profile Hokas (2014) to attract new customers
* New "oversized" shoes are still larger than conventional shoe dimensions, but they are closer to what has been normal

### Marketing

* Signed sponsorship with elite track athletes to demonstrate that the brand was not just for old runners and ultra-marathoners
* For a sector that was predominantly very white and very male, Hoka has tried to shift fanbase to women and a racially diverse space
* Found credible influencers in podiatrists, who regularly recommend the brand to runners with plantas fascilitis

## Maintaining brand DNA: technical performance

* Hoka has continued to invest in being the leader in performance shoes for ultra-long distance runners
* 2019 time trial where ultrarunner Jim Walmsley set new 50-mile world best record in Hoka shoes

## What did Hoka do differently?

* Don't avoid distribution / reject anything that isn't DTC
* Omni-channel is a good thing, for awareness, for audience segmentation, inventory management
* Insistence on maintaining what makes it distinctive
* Large soles serve a purpose for runners, but also serve as a moat
  * Other running brands cannot imitate the large soles look without "copying Hoka"

## Brand flywheel model

* Great brands are not just the result of strong marketing, but a company operating model that connects brand and product to underlying operations
* Ikea's flat pack furniture, out-of-city locations, customer assembly - all "features" of the company's operating model allow the company to save costs and offer products at lower price points
