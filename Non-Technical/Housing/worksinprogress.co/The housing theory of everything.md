# [The housing theory of everything](https://worksinprogress.co/issue/the-housing-theory-of-everything/)

* Costs are especially high in places whose economics are built on intangible capital, like software or financial services
  * Especially large benefits to people being near one another
* Since 1980, NYC metro area houses are up 706%
  * SF = 932%
  * London = 2,100%
* Almost every other household product has become better and less expensive
  * Compared to 1975, the number of hours a median American worker would have to work to buy a TV fell from 60 to 7 hours (2013)
  * 67 -> 30 hours for a washer/dryer

## The hidden effects of expensive housing

### Productivity
* When housing is scarce in high-productivity areas, people are priced out of the area altogether
* People then end up working in less productive jobs than they would have if it was easier for them to move to more productive areas
* People that do end up living in high-productivity places _also_ end up being less productive than they could be
  * They are less able to combine their skills with complementary skills of the people that have been priced out of living in these high-productivity areas
* In the US, productivity per worker tends to rise by 2%+ with each doubling of city size
  * Only true of cities with skilled, educated workers
  * Suggests productivity increase is mostly driven by the transfer of knowledge and division of labor amongst highly-skilled workers
  * Metro areas that are largely made up of unskilled workers do not become more productive as they get bigger
* American cities are sparsely populated and sprawling compared to Europe
  * Paris, Barcelona, London are more densely populated than almost every metropolitan area in America except Manhattan
  * Due to regulations that ban buildings that make better use of the land
* According a study, if NYC, San Jose, SF loosened their rules against building denser housing to the national average, millions would move to jobs that would make the best use of their skills
  * US GDP would be ~9% higher
  * Average American wages would be ~$9k higher

### Innovation
* From US patent information, low-density places can sustain specialized clusters
  * Unconventional breakthroughs benefit from high-density urban environments
* Localization benefits dissipate within 10 miles for software
  * Half a mile for advertising

### Inequality
* In places like Tokyo, and Seoul, rising housing demand leads to more supply, not higher prices
* Fixed housing supply means that some percentage of the increases in aggregate income is transferred to land owners
  * For example, value from improvements like a new park would be captured by local landowners
  * This transfer of income to landowners was particularly strong in states that have highly restrictive rules against building more homes

### Left-behind areas and regional inequality
* In 1960, a cleaner could move to NYC from Alabama and earn wages that were 84% higher
  * Even after the higher cost of living in NYC, they'd end up with 70% higher income, after rent
  * To contrast, in 2010, they'd earn a 28% higher wage, but since housing costs are so much higher, their net earnings and living standards would fall
* Many Western countries have regions where the most economically productive people move away, leaving their lower-skilled peers behind

### Families
* Expensive housing forces people to wait to have kids and/or move out of city cores and into cheaper suburbs
  * Adds long commutes, reduces job options
* Fewer siblings, less time spent with grandparents, social/human costs
