# [37 Lessons (Or So) From A 37 Year Old](https://ryanholiday.medium.com/37-lessons-or-so-from-a-37-year-old-8c4c5bdf61be)

* The most important decision you make is to be in a good mood
  * "You've got two choices today - you can be happy or very happy. Which will it be?"
* An athlete doesn't think about whether a throw is good or bad. They just catch it and throw it back.
* Rich is how much you see your kids and power is how much power you have over your own schedule
* Author doesn't have goals - they just have things that they like doing
  * Only goal is to continue to do the things they like
  * Results / accomplishment are a byproduct of this process
* If "success" (however it's measured) doesn't make you a better person, it's not success
* Self-improvment will make you better professionally, but the converse is less true - getting better and better at your job doesn't necessarily make you a better spouse/parent/citizen
* Things take time, and adding time in the beginning (by not getting started) or in the middle (by not responding promptly) or at the end (by not finishing and moving to the next thing) make it take longer
* Doing things when burnt out or tired can lead to more work in the long run as you may have to undo mistakes made because you couldn't think clearly
* You are most certainly not saying enough positive stuff. You're not saying 'good job' enough or 'thank you' enough or 'I love you' enough
  * Compliment, congratulate, and appreciate more
* The fewer opinions you have, the happier you'll be
  * If you do have opinions about things that don't really matter, hold them lightly and in good humor
