## What Boredom Tells Us

* Understand when a boring situation should be endured or is evidence that something must change
* People are conditioned to do one of two things in the face of boredom - escape with entertainment or distraction, or resign themselves that this is an inevitable part of life and to comply
* Knee-jerk boredom avoidance leads to quick fix vulnerability
* Resignation to boredom leads to lack of human agency
* “I’m bored; there’s nothing to do” - the bored person literally cannot see or imagine something worthwhile
* Boredom is usually associated with a lack of stimuli, but can also be prompted by too much stimuli
* When facing boredom directly, we see though our inauthentic proclivities and discern that culture has inauthentic ways of being
* At the nadir of boredom, a vision of possibilities for authentic existence becomes clearer
* According to 4th-century monk, to suffer from boredom is to let yourself go - to become careless
* The “cure” is to do everything with great care, and fruitfully engage in one thing at a time

## Focal Practices

* Focal practice trains and guides us to attend deeply, in a sustained way, to one thing, overcoming the temptation to move from one thing to the next
* The price of technological convenience comes at the expense of focal practices
* Microwave pre-packaged food vs. cooking or staring at screens instead of walking to relax

## Remedies for the Bored Self

* Focal practices are often within reach, but have a high threshold to overcome
* Bored self is unable to see the possibilities latent within a focal practice
* Burdensome part of these activities is the task of getting over some threshold of effort, as soon as the threshold is crossed, the burden disappears
* Tasks like walking, washing the dishes, writing letters, all seem seem dull and offer little to alleviate boredom, and yet, once we begin to undertake them and settle in, new possibilities come into view
* Given the minimal thresholds of amusement culture, we can easily flit from one thing to the next, and become more curious than studious
* Rather than a single focus of attention, the bored self is captivated by a multitude of interests
