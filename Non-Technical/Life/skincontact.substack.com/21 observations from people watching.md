# [21 observations from people watching](https://skincontact.substack.com/p/21-observations-from-people-watching)
* Polite has a mechanical quality to it, carrying out all the right movements
  * Polite comes from the mind, it is restrained and calculated
* Happy has a boundless quality - it has an unpredictability, allowing another person to surprise and delight
  * There is no script for happy
* People who don't pause exist more in their head than their body
  * The mind is waiting for the other person to be done, so they can say what's rattling around inside
* Can see how much someone accpets themselves by looking for intense distortions in the way they are interacting with the world
  * Find the range in how they treat people
  * Never met a person who looks down on others and unconditionally accepted themselves
  * For people who are self-accepting, their baseline patience and goodwill does not fall and rise intensely
* The person in the room who thinks they are better than everyone is uninterested in giving any of their attention to anyone else
* Look for unfounded apologies if you want to see how much someone believes in their right to exist
* Elastic individual
  * Openness and curiosity that does not need to be announced
  * Not the loudest, but because they exhibit an unconditional acceptance of everyone, they are usually well-loved
