# [The secret life of people with high self-control (itâ€™s easier than you think)](https://riikkaiivanainen.medium.com/the-secret-life-of-people-with-high-self-control-its-easier-than-you-think-7dd26fb5282c)

* Resisting temptation is tiring and results in mental fatigue ("ego depletion")
  * Study where participants execute a task that requires resisting temptation (eating radishes while staring at a bowl of cookies)
  * Then participants do another unrelated task, like a puzzle
  * Those that need to exert self-control in the first half of the study perform worse in the second half (the puzzle)
* People describing themselves as good self-controllers seemed to have weaker, not stronger, self-control muscles
* People with high levels of trait self-control are good at avoiding temptation - not resisting it
  * If good self-controllers generally avoid temptation, it's understandable that they'd perform poorly when put into an artificial situation in which they're forced to resist temptation
* By relying on stable habits and routines, individuals with better self-control can enact important behaviors more automatically and effortlessly
* Good self-controllers use self-control more strategically or at an earlier stage
* Avoiding temptation is a meta-regulation strategy to manage self-regulatory resources effectively
  * Avoiding temptations allows the prevention of presumably greater willpower that would be necessary to resist them
