# [The 5% Rule](https://jonpauluritis.com/articles/5-percent-rule/)

* Author worked retail and SMB sales, talking to 13k-15k people between '09 and '13
* "No matter how kind, warm, thoughtful, amazing, cheerful, consistent, and perfect I treated people roughly 5% of them would just be terrible "
  * "There was a legit 3% to 5% of people that just wanted to be mean, nasty, selfish brutes. "
* "...this number has held up in other parts of my life too (dating, restaurant customers, etc). And if you ask anyone who has done big numbers working with people they'll say the same thing (my doctor friends specifically would say I'm being generous)."
* "The optimistic take is that if 3%-5% of people just suck, you really have permission to free your mind of those people and just focus on taking care of the people who don't suck. Just expect it and move about your day."
