# [What the Second-Happiest People Get Right](https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2022/03/chasing-happiness-leads-to-dissatisfaction/629427/?utm_source=pocket_collection_story)

* Students who were "very happy" performed worse than students who were merely "happy"
* Tracking college freshmen's "cheerfulness" and their income two decades later
  * Those who were most cheerful were not the highest earners
  * Highest earners were second-most cheerful group - "above average"
* Pursuing happiness to the exclusion of other goals (psychological hedonism)
* An aversion to unhappiness can lead us to forgo a meaningful life
  * When people talk about their fear of failure, their true source of fear in many cases centers on how they will feel about having failed, not about the consequences of the failure itself
* Discomfort with uncertainty causes more anxiety than guaranteed bad news
* To avoid these bad feelings, people give up all kinds of opportunities that involve the possibility of failure
* Risk doesn't necessarily make people happy, but it can also bring bigger rewards than a life played safe
* Those with the highest performance at work and school made decisions that were probably unpleasant at times, and even scary
