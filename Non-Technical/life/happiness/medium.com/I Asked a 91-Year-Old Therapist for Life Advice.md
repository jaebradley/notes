* Most important skill of living a happy life - gratitude
* Few people appreciate the good things that happen every day
* Social media exacerbates lack of gratitude as it makes it easier for us to compare our life to others
* Happiness is not based on comparison
* "I'm not happy because what I'm eating right now tastes better than what I ate yesterday - I'm grateful because I enjoy the taste right now"
* Even amid chaos in your life, you can appreciate a short rest
* Happiness is the sum of what we are grateful for every day
