# [Why time seems to pass faster as we age](https://invertedpassion.com/why-time-seems-to-pass-faster-as-we-age/)

* Author's thesis is that the experience of time passing faster the older we get is due to our brains being efficient storage devices
* Brains are efficient prediction devices and main purpose is to construct a model of the world
  * Wants to be able to predict things like making money, making people laugh, etc
* Because it wants to be efficient, our brains only pay attention to memories that are new and surprising
* As children, everything is new and surprising, so our brain has a lot of novel information to store
  * Because there is more data stored from those periods of time, those days feel longer
* As we get older, "new" memories are mostly just diffed patches on existing memories
  * Similar to certain version control systems, no need to store full memories from each event, just the surprising new information that hasn't been experienced before
* In other words, as life becomes more and more repetitive the older we get, there are fewer novel moments in time we end up storing in our memory
* When we reflect back on the time in our lives, we naturally access our memory, the majority of which is comprised of moments from childhood
  * This is what makes us feel like we've accumulated time in the past but not the present
* Thus, the main culprit in this feeling of time speeding-up is predictability
  * i.e. the more predictable your days are, the shorter they will feel
* Predictability impacts perception of time in present _and_ in the future
* To "slow down" time, add unpredictability to life by taking on projects you don't know anything about
* As we age, we naturally attempt to exploit more of the world around us than to explore more
* Boredom is not a solution to slowing down time - it's diving head-first into unknown territory
* Traveling physically or mentally in "radical" ways keeps the brain on its toes and provides more memorable moments
