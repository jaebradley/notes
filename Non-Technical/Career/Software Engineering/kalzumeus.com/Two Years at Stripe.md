# [Two Years at Stripe](https://www.kalzumeus.com/2019/3/18/two-years-at-stripe/)

* Clear company-level mission - “Increase the GDP of the Internet”
* Stripe work culture of “nothing is ‘Not My Job’”
* Internal “red-team” exercise of trying to steal “All The Money” aka find security vulnerabilities
* Understand what is technically possible + ability to implement quickly + good mental model for the business at a micro and macro level
* micro-level = “what’s normal behavior for an Internet-based software business”
* macro-level = “where are weak points in global financial infrastructure? what type of exposure do we have to these weak points? how can we limit exposure?”

## Why work at Stripe when you could run your own business?

* Author has a “success function” - # of community members helped (i.e. software folks) * the benefit in the average life that his help has uniquely caused
* For example, author’s article on compensation negotiation for engineers was probably the most effective thing they’ve done (using compensation as the success metric) as hundreds of peope have reaped compensation benefits from the article)
* Stripe can educate and advise entrpreneurs (and coincidentally, entrepreneurship directly benefits Stripe as a business)
* Increasing the pace of business formation, likelihood of business survival, rate of business growth, etc Stripe benefits
* Professional output over 12 years has been making businesses 1% better and doing that over and over again
* The search for leverage also means occasionally picking projects other than the ones the author would want to do “ceteris paribus” (all else equal)
* Ambition, properly harnessed, can be an enormously productive force in the world
* Unserious ends and lies are not positive, and we probably underestimate the number of teams doing very import work

## Being a senior individual contributor

* Get leverage by directing people to do things or making them more effective at doing things

## Writing, writing, writing

* Strategy memo = a PR for a complicated program that directs the activities of dozens / hundreds of people

## Fast and slow

* Constantly course correct understanding of what is “material impact” because through the search for material impact, things that were material a few years ago might not move the needle any more
* Keep culture to fight like hell for the (expansive) set of things which are very worth doing, but don’t obviously move needles

## Creating things which matter

* The reason the Stripe product pages are very well-designed is that a very small group of very talented people care an almost unreasonable amount that they are phenomenal
* Route to greate work = hire small teams of very talented people who very intently care about something + incentivize great work amongst numerous other competing worthy priorities
* Many people at BigCo are incentivized to make locally-optimal decisions at the expense of competing global goals
* Solving the principal/agent problem at BigCo often involves allowing people to ask “What does the *best possible* version of this project look like?” and being OK with delaying things until they are ready
* Stripe has a tool to subscribe to daily emails about state changes to a certain set of objects (“For all the accounts I manage, email me the list of any accounts that hit some milsetone every morning”)
* Tools have an emphasis on being composable, so each additonal tool should add more value to current tooling / operations
