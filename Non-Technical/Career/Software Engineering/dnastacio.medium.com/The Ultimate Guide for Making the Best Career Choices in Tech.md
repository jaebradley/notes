# [The Ultimate Guide for Making the Best Career Choices in Tech](https://dnastacio.medium.com/hierarchy-of-career-priorities-c18768d32598)

## Hierarchy of Career Priorities

* Similar to Maslow's Hierachy of Needs (from bottom of pyramid / most important to least important)
* Employability - basic requirements around education, training, skills
* Compensation and Stability - adequate compensation matching time and skill, supportive work environment
* Growth and Development - continuous learning, skill enhancement, professional development
  * Development to retain future employability
* Work-Life Balance and Well-Being - Healthy work/life balance, managing stress, prioritizing mental and physical health
* Purpose and Meaning - individuals seek purpose and meaning in their chosen careers
  * Finding fulfillment beyond material and external rewards
* Should try and align layers (generally impossible to align all layers perfectly all the time)
  * Awareness of eventual / current imbalances allows correction sooner rather than later
 
## Notes

* Skip the temptation of chasing what is popular today and look at what is trending towards popularity within the next three years
* To prioritize employability, find the moving center of the mainstream
* Author's cautionary story of being on the "bleeding edge" of technology
  * Worked on technology that competed with Kubernetes
  * Knowledge of competing technology were "worthless" in the job market
* Continuously monitor career progression against the Hierarchy of Career Priorities
* No wrong career paths, but careless career steps
