# [Notes to Myself on Software Engineering](https://medium.com/@francois.chollet/notes-to-myself-on-software-engineering-c890f16f4e4d)

* Before you write any code, make sure your solution of choice cannot be made any simpler. 
* Someone who has domain experience, but no experience with your API, should be able to intuitively understand your API using minimal documentation, mostly just by looking at a couple of code examples and seeing what objects are available and what their signatures are.
* The meaning of an argument should be understandable without having any context about the underlying implementation. Arguments that have to be specified by users should relate to the mental models that the users have about the problem, not to implementation details in your code.
  * An API is all about the problem it solves, not about how the software works in the background.
* Choose data structures that naturally fit the domain at hand â€” that match the mental models of domain experts.

## On Software Careers

* Agency over work and circumstances is key to life satisfction. Grant sufficient self-direction to the people around you.
  * Make sure your career choices result in greater agency for yourself.
* Productivity = rapid decision making and action. Requires good intuition (which comes from experience) to make generally correct decisions given partial information.
  * Knowing when to move carefully and wait for more information as the cost of an incorrect decision would be greater than the cost of delay.
