# [A Bunch of Programming Advice I’d Give To Myself 15 Years Ago](https://mbuffett.com/posts/programming-advice-younger-self/)

## If you (or your team) are shooting yourselves in the foot constantly, fix the gun

* These things stick around a weird amount because there's never a natural time to address them

## Spending time sharpening the axe is almost always worth it

* You should know all the major shortcuts in your editor
* You should be a confident and fast typist
* One of the biggest green flags I've seen in engineers is a level of care in choosing and becoming proficient with their tools

## If you can’t easily explain why something is difficult, then it’s incidental complexity, which is probably worth addressing

* A high percentage of time, manager that challenged complexity of system exposed incidental complexity

## Make debugging easier

* Stay vigilant about how much of your debugging time is spent on setup, reproduction, and cleanup afterwards
* If it’s over 50%, you should figure out how to make it easier, even if that will take slightly longer this time
* Bugs should get easier to fix over time, all else being equal.

## Shipping cadence matters a lot. Think hard about what will get you shipping quickly and often

* Consistent reusable patterns, that you can compose together for new screens/features/endpoints
* Shipping slowly should merit a post-mortem as much as breaking production does. Our industry doesn’t run like that, but that doesn’t mean you can’t personally follow the north star of Shipping Fast.
