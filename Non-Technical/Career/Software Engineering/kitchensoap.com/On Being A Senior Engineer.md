# [On Being A Senior Engineer](https://www.kitchensoap.com/2012/10/25/on-being-a-senior-engineer/)

* Author expects a “senior” engineer to be a *mature* engineer
* Mature engineers seek out constructive criticism of their designs
* “Shoot as many holes as possible into my thinking”
* Mature engineers understand the non-technical areas of how they are perceived
* Self-awareness when it comes to their communication
* Aim is to be assertive - not passive nor aggresive in terms of getting ideas across
* The degree to which people want to work with you is a direct indication of how successful you’ll be in your career as an engineer - be the engineer that everyone wants to work with
* It’s a junior engineer mistake to toss insults about a piece of complex technology in 140 characters
* Mature engineers do not shy away from making estimates and are always trying to get better at it
* Mature engineers have an innate sense of anticipation, even if they don’t know they do
* Mature engineers lift the skills and expertise of those around them - “move over lemme just do it for you” vs. “let’s work on this together, I can show you how I’m writing/troubleshooting/etc. then you do it, so I can be sure you know why/how we’re doing it this way”
* The only true authority stems from knowledge, not from position. Knowledge engenders authority and authority engenders respect
