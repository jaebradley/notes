# [Hiring and the market for lemons](https://danluu.com/hiring-lemons/)

* Joel Spolsky claims that
  * "Great" developers won't have that many jobs compared to "bad" developers because companies will try to keep "great" developers
  * Companies are also able to recognize prospective "great" developers easily
* You could also make the claim that "great" developers are overrepresented in the job market because they have better job opportunities
  * And it's actually "bad" developers that will cling to their jobs

## Market for Lemons
* If there's no way to distinguish between good cars and lemons, good cars and lemons will sell for the same price
* Since buyers can't distinguish, the price they're willing to pay is based on the quality of the average in the market
* Since owners know if their car is a lemon or not, owners of non-lemons won't sell because the average price is driven down by the existence of lemons
* This causes lemons to be the only available used cars

## Incomplete information
* Author has an example where information transfer inside of a company is so poor that external management has a better view of someone's productivity than internal management

## Dysfunctional organizations
* Functional teams tend not to have openings (as teammembers are happy and want to stay on those teams)
  * Dysfunctional teams tend to have openings and are hiring
  * As a dev, if you join a random team, you're much more likely to join a team that has a lot of churn
* Author asked question at conference - "do you know of any companies that aren't highly dysfunctional?"
  * Not one single person told me that their company meets the first criteria
  * Most non-negative answers were framed as "X company is ok - I know a few people there and I haven't heard any terrible horror stories yet"
* Author also asked - "do you know of any particular teams that are great and are hiring?"
  * Most common answer was "if I knew that, I'd go work there"
  * Another common answer was "I know some of the people on {insert well known team} and it sounds great"
  * There are a few teams that are well known for being great places to work, but it's basically impossible to get a job on one of those teams

## Hiring manager problems
* Pay too little
  * Author found a 6x compensation spread between companies who would hire him in the same geographic region
  * All the companies thought they were competitive, even when they were at the bottom of the range
* Passing on good developers
  * Joel claims that 30 people will be solid, and thus 970 will be incompetent
  * Author claims that closer to 400 will be solid and 20 will be really good
    * But everybody uses the same filters, so everybody ends up fighting over the 30 people that they think are solid
  * Author mentions law firm recruiting study that found being male and having a "high-class" signal (sailing, polo, etc) with no other changes related in a 4x increase in interview invites
  * Sticking with the "standard" strategy of picking people with brand name pedigrees and running the same interview process as everyone else will bid up the price of people that are "trendy" and ignore everyone else
* Hiring for some combination of rare skills
* They're much more dysfunctional than they realize
  * Hiring manager doesn't realize that everyone on their team is unhappy and that his team has been giving anti-referrals to friends telling them to stay away
  * Quite common to see a VP baffled by why hiring is so hard when employees consider the place to be mediocre or even bad
* Author posits that "trendy" hiring practices is the equivalent of "no one ever got fired for hiring IBM"
* "Great" devs have a hard time getting hired, even though their network knows they're great, because they don't "look" like what people think great developers look like
