# [How good engineers write bad code at big companies](https://www.seangoedecke.com/bad-code-at-big-companies/)
* Big companies are full of engineers working outside their area of expertise
  * Average big tech employee stays for only a year or two
  * Expect a re-org at least once a year (sometimes even more frequently)
* Average tenure of a codebase is obviously much longer than the average employee tenure so a high percentage of code changes are made by beginners / people that have onboarded to the codebase in the past six months
* Problem is somewhat mitigated by experienced engineers that have stayed at the company but have rotated away from the codebase
* Big tech companies make little effort to develop and retain long-term expertise in individual systems
* Experienced engineers are always overloaded and being involved in reviewing changes and discuussions impacts their velocity
* Author argues that big tech companies prioritize internal legibility - the ability to see, at a glance, which engineers are working on what projects
  * Big tech companies proritize being able to change priorities quickly over productivity
  * Big tech companies know that treating engineers as fungible and moving them around destroys long-term productivity
  * This is a deliberate tradeoff so that they are able to deploy skilled engineers on whatever the problem of the month is
* Individual engineers are powerless to alter this dynamic
  * Even becoming an "old hand" / developing expertise in a particular domain to block the worst changes is, at best, swimming against the organization's current and at worst, poor performance reviews
* If you could wave a magic wand and make every engineer twice as strong, poor code would still be written because almost nobody can come into a brand new codebase and quickly make changes with zero mistakes
