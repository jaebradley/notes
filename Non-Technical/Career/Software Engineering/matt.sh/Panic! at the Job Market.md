# [Panic! at the Job Market](https://matt.sh/panic-at-the-job-market)

* Interest rate = the price of money
* Higher interest rates = organizations with lots of cash can park money in interest accounts instead of taking on risky assets seeking outsized returns
* RIsky assets = funding start ups / companies with uncertain futures

# Company Structures

* 4 tech company categories: `nepo`, `speculation` (just an idea, no product, no customers, no product/market fit), `initial growth companies` (YC incubator), `stable`
* VC funding tends to slow down / vanish in high interest rate periods
* Higher interest rate periods means customers ahve more restrictive spending conditions
* Interest rate growht kills speculation companies, truncates / collapses initial growht companies into baseline sustenance mode

## Company Level to Compensation Scale

* “Academic researchers” form a fake company, vest shares, get acquired on basically a huge tax-advantaged hiring bonus at Big Tech X

### Initial Growth Company Pay Scale

* Worst combination of high-risk, low-reward, effort-vs-compensation tradeoffs
* People who just picked a better company to work at 20 years ago and have never left have been growing wealth by millions of dollars per year, every year, over the course of their career
* Primary purpose is to only make the founders rich
* Growth uptrend sub-category - company is actually working and will survive and turn into a stable era company
* Growth downtrend - worst of all worlds, decaying cycle of low comp + serial company layoffs as company is failing but refuses to not exist
* Stable, zero growth - no growth = no comp increases compared to people at “real” companies that have exponential comp growth due to passive yearly stock allocation

### Stable Era Company Pay Scale

* Long-lived organizations that are not going bankrupt due to quarterly market trends or government economic policy changes
* stable stable: consistently growing, consistently profitable, not Google or Apple, just churning out results
* stable unstable, stable-qua-ego: popular company + popular CEO. Manic/blipolar as their CEOs, floating between mega growth and mega collapse phases
* stable neutronium - a company controlling 1+ sectors of the global economy and can’t be broken. Stable management, exponentially growing stock, exponentially growing compensation for useful employees

## Scaling Laws

* Failing Leetcode-style interview makes interviewer assume you are in the 0 to 55 range, but they wouldn’t be able to tell if you might be in the 120 to 200 range instead
* Hiring manager seemingly doesn’t know how anything works but is also in change of product architecture

### The Great Attractor

* In what world should I put in the same effort to join a zero-growth unprofitable company going out of business in 3 years compared to multi-trillion dollar company paying 30x startup compensation
* The goal of the culture check is primarily to determine how a candidate handles the tradeoffs between progress and kindness
* Compromise is not always good. Finding middle ground between a broken solution and a working solution doesn’t leave you with a working solution. Compromise can happen around opinions but not facts.

## Field Notes

* AWS isn’t hands off “zero-experience needed magic cloud” it is a “datacenter as a service” and datacenter / network architecture experience is valuable / AWS account is probably not in a good state
* Example of company-wide bad practice that started with an implementation by somebody with no experience in domain that trickled across entire org
* Companies double-down on ideas that worked in past but are now dead ideas at a dead company
* Pattern: rudderless companies end up in a situation where they are so desperate for sales that the sales incentives are outsized relative to dev compensation
