## The “Do It Anyway” Principle

> At our team standup meetings, we would go over the progress of things, and I would see people divide into two general categories. The first category was people who were similarly frustrated and fed-up with the work environment issues we faced. They were more vocal about it though and would complain about these issues frequently, even though they were for the most part, out of our collective control.

> Tasks assigned to people in this first group would frequently get delayed, due to the problems we faced with the development environment. Each day when we met and someone said they could not finish something because of some obstacle that cropped up, it was never really challenged because it was pretty unreasonable to expect people to be productive given various problems we faced. The net effect though was, the tasks assigned to this group of people were not really getting done.

> The second category of people, which I would try my best to be in (but admittedly, not always succeed) would be the people that somehow got their tasks done anyway, even though there were ridiculous constraints imposed by our environment issues that made it a lot harder. My own personal way of dealing with this would be to look at it as a challenge, like: Can I pick up wet grapes with chopsticks? Can I run more than 100 feet without throwing up because I’m so out of shape? View everything as unnecessary feats I clearly was not expected to do but would attempt, anyway.

> You can take the stance that you should not be expected to be productive in a bad work environment, and you would be right. If that motivates you to affect change in the environment, it is great. But sometimes, we do not have that luxury.

## The “Two-And-Done” Rule

> So the Two-And-Done rule was born, wherein I will state my case the first time, and if whoever is arguing to the contrary does not agree after hearing my position, I’ll let it go. But the next time the opportunity comes up, I will argue my point again. Maybe allowing for a gap of time for people to consider my original point, or maybe allowing me time to refine and rephrase my ideas to be more convincing.

> If I fail to get my way after the second time though, I am done. I will even say as much to whomever I am debating if they are the final decision-maker. I will say something like, “OK, let’s go your way then. I still don’t completely agree with everything proposed here, but I think I’ve made my case, and we need to move on.”

> Yielding in an argument like this has some weird, powerful effects. One is, it kind of releases you from responsibility if things should go wrong. And if a truly bad decision has been made, it is actually pretty likely that things will start going wrong. (Important Note: If you fail to convince people after two tries, you really do have to get behind the decision, and not try to sabotage or undermine it)

>  it bumps up your personal brand, as someone who should maybe be listened to more often. Sometimes though you end up just having to live with not getting your way, and learn to truly let go of whatever it was. But more often than you might expect, this technique will end up causing things to pivot back your way, eventually.
