# [Some career advice.](https://lethain.com/career-advice/)

* Don't assume you'll make this much money forever
* Decisions are not permanent
* There are probably 10-20 key decisions you'll make that define career trajectory (mostly around companies that were joined and roles taken)
  * Always try and have a portfolio of options and pick amongst them vs. comparing between current situation and new one in soolation
* Stay humble
* Even if you enter the industry without much prestige, can build prestige over time by working at increasingly well-respected companies, writing online, etc
* Be discoverable - getting access to most exceptionally interesting jobs depends on first being widely discoverable
* Don't chase roles you'll hate - learn how you'd spend your time in the roles you're considering, and make sure it aligns with what you personally need
* Don't stay comfortable too long
* Don't have to be career-optimizing all the time
* Great relationships will follow you everywhere you go (same with bad ones)
* Early in your career, try to work at as many different kinds of companies and in different product verticals as you can
