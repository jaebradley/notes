# [How to send progress updates](https://www.spakhm.com/updates-howto)

* Know what your next update will be and work toward it (instead of coming up with an update when it’s time to send one)
* Start with a one sentence tl;dr and 2-4 sentence recap of overall goals. Assume audience is smart, but is very busy and remembers nothing of your work
* Deliver negative news in 2-3 escalating phases. Softly express the possibility of a problem. The next time, state the problem as a fact. Obviously, don’t do this for an actual emergency or crisis.
* Acknowledge changes explicitly. People perceive acknowledged inconsistencies as the cost of doing business, but unacknowledged inconsistencies as broken promises
* Don’t insult anyone, accidentally, or on purpose
* Tone should reflect the text equivalent of pilot radio voice
* Author visualizes themselves in a third-person view physically separate from the work, and pretend this character is writing the update
* Know the top three questions your audience wants answered and state the answers as clearly as possible
* Add a dedicated section for worries and failures
* The goal of updates is for your audience to know how your project is doing at any given time without having to ask you
