# [These Are Leadership Ideas I Try To Apply Every Day](https://ryanholiday.medium.com/these-are-leadership-ideas-i-try-to-apply-every-day-8d5421faeedc)
* “What’s your philosophy?”
* Festina Lente - make haste slowly
* Sense of urgency, with a purpose - getting things done properly and consistently
* “Have we started the clock on this?”
* “Don’t touch paper twice” - if you look at an email, etc, complete the task then and there
* “You are calling me to tell me that you did your job”
* If you are stuck in a loop, not applying lessons, it’s not going to work
* ‘My leadership philosophy is that when I give you a task, that’s your task. Your job is to handle it and be in charge of it. If I have to follow up with you, if I have to push you to get started, if I have to check your work, then I may as well have done it myself. If you are coming to me with problems instead of solutions, you are putting it back on my plate. In a successful working relationship, I should be able to have an idea, go to the right person with it, and after I explain it say, “I’m leaving it with you”’
* Do the hard things first
