# [Game Theory Patterns at Work](https://daeus.blog/2026/01/18/game-theory-patterns-at-work/)
* Org conflicts are due to incentives instead of "values disagreements"
* Without clear rules, promotions favor likeability and narrative skill over impact
  * Thus, over time, strong performers who missed early promotion windows get frustrated and leave
* Limited promotion slots create zero-sum dynamics, pushing teammates to compete, hoard work, switch teams
* Leaders who encourage competition often think only about short-term achievements ("offense") such as moving metrics faster at the detriment of underestimating negative externalities ("defense") like information hiding/hoarding
* Firing the bottom 10% systematically inventivizes peer sabotage
* Assumes managers can objectively identify true low performers and not just people that they dislike or are convenient to fire
* Making internal transfers easy helps retain strong people who are simply mismatched
* Pass/fail technical screens (like LeetCode) filter out candidates who cannot break down and solve problems in the language they will actually use
* Data orgs without any coding or SQL technical screens devolve into politics as a substitute for technical skill
* Training people well while accepting some will leave beats undertraining to retain
* Sometimes having a dedicated skeptic role in a group can improve decisions (people tolerate friction better when they know it's intentional)
* Products often reflect org structures and companies ship their org charts
* Unclear ownership creates avoidance and turf wars, especially around risky legacy systems
* Bugs are visible and rewarded while prevention is silent
  * Without clarity, people rationally pursue short-term fixes over long-term platform health
