# [Beating the Averages](https://paulgraham.com/avg.html

* "Lisp is worth learning for the profound enlightment experience you will have when you finally get it; that experience will make you a better programmmer for the rest of your days, even if you never actually use Lisp itself a lot"
* Software is a very competitive businessk, prone to natural monopolies
* A company that gets software written faster and better will, all other things being equal, put its competitors out of business
* When you choose technology, you have to ignore what other people are doing, and consider only what will work the best
* A startup can't do what all the other startups do
* If you do everything the way the average startup does it, you should expect average performance - average performance means that you'll go out of business

## The Blub Paradox

* "Blub" is a hypothetical language that is not the most powerful language, but is more powerful than machine language
* When our hypothetical Blub programmer looks up the power contiuum, he doesn't realize he is looking up - what he sees are merely weird languages
  * He probably considers them about equivalent in power to Blub, but with all this other hairy stuff thrown in
* Thus, following this train of thought, the only programmers in a position to see all the power differences between the various languages are those who understand the most powerful ones
* Blub paradox: programmers are satisfied with whatever language they use because it dictates the way they think about programs

## Aikido for Startups

* Handy tip for evaluating competitors - read their job listings
* PG was not worried about companies that wanted Oracle experience, or C++ / Java developers
* PG was most worried about Perl or Python programmers as the "technical side was run by real hackers"
