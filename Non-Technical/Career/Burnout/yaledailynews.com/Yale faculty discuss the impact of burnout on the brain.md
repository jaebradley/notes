# [“How people fall apart”: Yale faculty discuss the impact of burnout on the brain](https://yaledailynews.com/blog/2022/03/29/how-people-fall-apart-yale-faculty-discuss-the-impact-of-burnout-on-the-brain/)

* A person’s *perceived* ability to control a stressor is a key determinant of its effect on their brain
* If someone is overwhelmed by what is being asked of them, believing it is beyond their capabilities, even if it is not, will view the task as something to be afraid of
* Stress signaling pathways will weaken parts of the prefrontal cortex and strengthen more primitive parts of the brain
* Symptoms of breakdown begin when concentration degrades (“tip of tongue”, lose things, emotional harsh speech) - eventually system breaks down and rest is needed to refocus and recover
* The prefrontal cortex does not function well under stress - virtually all studies have found that mental illness always involves the prefrontal cortex
* Phases of burnout
  1. emotional exhaustion, feeling worn out and drained where not even a good night’s sleep helps
  2. Depersonalization / cynicism where person is annoyed with others, has a shorter fuse
  3. Reduced sense of personal accomplishement - never feel like doing things effectively and feel ineffective and that the work you do doesn’t matter
* Amygdala looks for threats - when depressed, amygdala views neutral faces as sad or threatening
* Being in chronic stress, brain is concentraing on the negative and interprets things in a negative way
* Have a low threshold for reaching out for help
* Balanced diet, deep breathing, exercise, good sleep
* To allow the prefrontal cortex to rest, do hands-on activities: arts, cooking, going for a walk, engaging in nature, and talking to people. Also quiet the mind through sports, or yoga
