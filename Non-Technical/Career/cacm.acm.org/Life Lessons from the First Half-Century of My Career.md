# [Life Lessons from the First Half-Century of My Career](https://cacm.acm.org/opinion/life-lessons-from-the-first-half-century-of-my-career/)

* Author never wanted to say: "If I had to do it all over again, I wish I had spent more time with my family"
  * Author volunteered for all the activities that his children were in
* Take time to have fun and find time to "play" (walks, cycle, lift weights, etc)
* Everyone loves praise and approval and the cost of praise is small while the value to others is high
* At the author's project retreats, enforce rule that no one argues with feedback
  * Recruit reviewers you know won't be fans, so you'll get unvarnished comments
* Benchmarks shape a field
  * For the author, papers and funding are often times benchmarks for institutions
  * When really, the "true" benchmark is have an impact, which may involve high-risk, high-reward projects
* Beware of those who believe they are the smartest people in the room
  * They believe there is nothing to learn by asking for feedback
  * Also avoid insecure people, as they tend to see credit as a zero-sum game, needing to diminish others in order to bolster themselves
* It's not how many projects you start, it's how many you finish
  * You will be remembered for the five or six really important things you do, rather than a long list of minor contributions
* "I was wrong. You were right. I love you."
  * No substitutions, no "but"s
