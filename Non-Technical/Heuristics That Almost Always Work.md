# [Heuristics That Almost Always Work](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/heuristics-that-almost-always-work)

* First example is a security guard that works in a rural city and develops a seful heuristic: if he hears a noise, he might as well ignore it since it's just the wind
  * The heuristic is right 99/9% of the time, which is pretty good / accurate and saves him a lot of trouble
  * Issue is that he provides no value - he could losslessly be replaced by a rock with the words "THERE ARE NO ROBBERS" on it
* Another example of a doctor who always says "it's nothing, it'll get better on its own"
  * She's usually right, and if she does this her entire career, and is lucky, nothing bad will happen
  * More likely, some number of patients will die of X because she will miss it
  * Though her heuristic is right a vast majority of the time, she provides no value
* A heuristic produces a prior of 99.9% that the thing won't happen in general
  * Consult a bunch of experts who all claim they have additional evidence that the thing won't happen, and you raise your probability to 99.999%
  * But experts were just using the same heuristic you were, and you should have stayed at 99.9%
