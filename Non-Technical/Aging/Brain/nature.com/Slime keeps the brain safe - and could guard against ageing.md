# [‘Slime’ keeps the brain safe ― and could guard against ageing](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00554-w)

* Slimy barrier lining the brain's blood vessels play key role in shielding the brain from harmful effects of aging
  * Molecules called mucins
* Barrier deteriorates over time, potentially allowing harmful molecules into brain tissue
* Gene therapy to restore this barrier reduced inflammation in the brain
* Mucins are large proteins decorated with carbohydrates that form linkages with one another
  * Results in a water-laden gel-like substance
* Blood-brain barrier erodes with age
* Mucins in the blood vessels of younger mice were much healthier than those in older mice
* A decrease in the enzyme activity producing these mucins caused the blood-brain barrier to become weaker
  * Bolstering these enzymes in older mice increased their performance on learning and memory tests
* Mucins might be an "active" sieve in that they are actively shuttling certain compounds across the blood-brain barrier and excluding others
