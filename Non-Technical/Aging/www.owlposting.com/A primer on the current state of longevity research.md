## Did the therapeutic focus on sirtuins amount to much?

* Studies in 2000s showed that younger people had more sirtuin activity and older people had less
* Overexpression of certain sirtuin genes led to lifespan increases, and downregulation led to lifespan decreases
* Sirtuins are dependent on NAD+ to perform their primary function - increasing NAD+ levels could also be a way to increase sirtuin activity

### Answer

* Nothing particularly useful has come from sirtuin-focused therapies
* 2023 review of all ongoing NAD+ focused clinical trials were underwhelming
* Only increases healthspan very very mildly

## Has cellular reprogramming yielded anything useful?

* Able to (slowly) convert skin cells to stem cells
* Over this weeks-long conversion, the cell is rejuvenating on a biochemical level
* Mitochondrial morphology is improved, telomeres are lengthened
* Removing cells from a human, “reprogramming” them, and then transplant them back in - but this is infeasible for most tissue types
* Telomere length and DNA mutations stay largely the same

## What’s the state of biological clocks?

* Epigenetic clocks are chemical markers that cover your DNA and affect how its converted to RNA and ultimately into proteins
* Markers are dynamic through one’s life, being impacted by diet, medication, lack of sleep
* Methyl groups are relevant to estimating biological aging, and the ration of unmethylated sites to methylated sites goes up with age
* Telomeres are the repetitive “ends” on chromosomes, and ment to serve as a buffer against the noisy process of cell division

## Answer

* Telomere length does not seem to be predictive of much
* Instead, the concept is telomere dysfunction or damage - so “long” telomeres that are “bad” because they are exposed to chronic peristent inflammation responses (like from oxidative stress)
* Epigenetic clocks based on transcripts and proteins have promise and there are recent papers that draw strong connections between transcripts, protein expression levels, and age-related cellular markers / organ dysfunction / mortality risk
