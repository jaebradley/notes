* At a basic level, blockchains are shared databases that store and verify information in a cryptographically secure way
  * An append-only Google spreadsheet that are maintained by a network of computers
  * These computers store their own copies of the database, adding / verifying new entries
  * These computers are generally public / open source so anybody can inspect a public blockchain's code or see a record of transactions
  * "Decentralized" meaning that this network of computers doesn't need a company like Google overseeing it
    * Instead there is some a consensus algorithm for determining what entries are in the database
    * Proponents argue this makes blockchains more secure since no single person / company can take down the blockchain
* Actual uses, aside from financial speculation
  * Sending money to family members across borders
  * Non-financial uses are fairly limited
* Critics call crypto a pyramid / Ponzi scheme
  * Early investors get rich at the expense of late investors (pyramid scheme)
  * Crypto projects lure in unsuspecting investors with promises of safe returns, then collapse once new money stops coming in (Ponzi scheme)
  * Crypto owners have a rational incentive to convince other people to buy crypto (if people believe in Bitcoin, they buy, and Bitcoin prices go up)
* Technical hurdles if crypto would ever displace government-issued currency
  * Bitcoin / Ethereum blockchains are slow and inefficient
    * Ethereum blockchain can only process 15 transactions per second, whereas Visa can process thousands of credit card transactions per second
  * Often can't be retrieved if it is stolen
* Some arguments that the blockchain's permanent, irrefutable records of ownership is attractive for marginalized groups who have had their property unjustly taken from them in the past
  * A small number of people own the vast majority of crypto wealth
* Extermists have also made money in the crypto market as crypto is attractive to all kinds of people who would rather not, or legally cannot deal, with a traditional bank
* Blockchains require a lot of energy
  * Bitcoin blockchain uses the annual energy consumption of Thailand
  * Existing financial system uses a lot of energy
  * Many crypto-mining computers are powered by renewable energy sources / by energy that would otherwise be wasted
